# Meaning of Life
The meaning of life is to find the meaning of life, which best suited to the self, out of the many-ness of meanings of lives and to align oneself with and to walk the chosen path.

In Law of One's words, it would be something like to realize the distortions within self - whether it is the distortions towards healing/patient, power/wisdom, lacking/gaining, light/love, love/light, and etc. - and to unite the positive and negative to resolve the paradox, thus moving into the path of One and into foreverness.

What is the meaning of life? That is a question from the self and an answer for the self.

It is part of The [[One Original Thought]]
- of The Infinite Creator asking itself who/what is this/that?
- of Light beings asking themselves what is mean to be light?
- of Dark beings asking themselves what is mean to be darkness?
- of beings capable of love asking themselves what is mean to love?
- of perfect beings asking themselves what is mean to be perfect?
- of immortal beings asking themselves what is mean to be immortal?
- of infinite beings asking themselves what is mean to be infinite?
Thus do we put ourselves in this finite illusion to realize the infinite potential that lies even within the "finite".

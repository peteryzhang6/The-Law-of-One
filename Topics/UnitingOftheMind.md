*This is a practice from RA of uniting the different concepts within one mind*

- One side is of the outward force of the Creator and one side is of the inward force of the Creator
- It is not to determine which is outward or inward at all times as through out time and space, the order changes
- The '/' represents the connection, thus two side and the connection is the showing of trinity that leads to infinity; uses '-' for WikiLinks
- The truth lies not in the 2 words but the connection formed by those 2 words, or the inward and outward of the same force 
- For each connection made is a unity or infinity created, for each unity uniting with other unity, a great unity is created, so on and on, into infinity
- To note not all terms listed below is 100% correct but contains personal distortion towards The Law of One

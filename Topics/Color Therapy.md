# Color Therapy
33.3: The instrument has a device for so-called color therapy, and since we were on, in the past session, the concept of the different colors I was wondering if these in some way apply to the principle of color therapy in the shining of particular colors on the physical body. Does this have any beneficial effect and can you tell me something about it?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This therapy, as you call it, is a somewhat clumsy and variably useful tool for instigating in an entityâ€™s mind/body/spirit complex an intensification of energies or vibrations which may be of aid to the entity. The variableness of this device is due firstly to the lack of true colors used, secondly, to the extreme variation in sensitivity to vibration among your peoples.

33.4: I would think that you could achieve a true color by passing the light through a crystal of the particular color. Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This would be one way of approaching accuracy in color. It is a matter of what you would call quality control that the celluloid used is of a varying color. This is not a great or even visible variation, however, it does make some difference given specific applications.

33.5: Possibly the use of a prism breaking white light into its spectrum and then screening off all parts of the spectrum except that which you wish to pass through a slit and use would be even better.

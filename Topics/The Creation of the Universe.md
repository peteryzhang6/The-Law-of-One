# The Creation of the Universe

- [[Intelligent Infinity]]
- [[TaoTeChing-Ch 1]]

[[John 1]]
God is the intelligent infinity/energy and the Word is the Love, the vibration. 

[[Genesis 1]]
Thus with the above understanding, when God said let there be light. The intelligent infinity/energy is being potentiated by the word "Let there be light", thus forming the light.

To view this in a natural analogy, one can see the relationship between clouds, rain, and ponds of water as God, the Word, and the Creation. The clouds are God. And the rain is the Word - "let there be light". Then as the rain hits the water and creates waves, it is the light, the creation, and thus the Word dwelled with us, the God becomes one with its creation. And as we "die" ([[Incarnation]]), or water evaporates, we return to God's side.

# The Creation of the Universe

- [[Intelligent Infinity]]
- [[TaoTeChing-Ch 1]]

[[John 1]]
God is the intelligent infinity/energy and the Word is the Love, the vibration. 

[[Genesis 1]]
Thus with the above understanding, when God said let there be light. The intelligent infinity/energy is being potentiated by the word "Let there be light", thus forming the light.

To view this in a natural understanding, one can see the relationship between clouds, rain, and ponds of water. The clouds are God. And the rain is the Word - "let there be light". Then as the rain hits the water and creates waves, it is the light, and thus the Word dwelled with us.

15.25: The Wanderers in this working are of two densities, one the density of five, that is, of light; one the density of love/light, or unity. To express the identity of which came from which density, we observe to be an infringement upon the free will of each. Therefore, we state simply the two densities, both of which are harmoniously oriented towards work together.

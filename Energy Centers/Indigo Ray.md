51.10: Immediately after the death of the physical body, you have stated that the, I believe Iâ€™m correct in saying that, primary activated body is the indigo, and you stated that it is the form-maker. Why is this so? Can you answer that?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This will be the last full query of this session of working.  
  
The indigo body may be seen to be an analog for intelligent energy. It is, in microcosm, the Logos. The intelligent energy of the mind/body/spirit complex totality draws its existence from intelligent infinity or the Creator. This Creator is to be understood, both in macrocosm and microcosm, to have, as we have said, two natures: the unpotentiated infinity which is intelligent; this is all that there is.  
  
Free will has potentiated both the Creator of us all and our selves as co-Creators with intelligent infinity which has will. This will may be drawn upon by the indigo, or form-making, body, and its wisdom used to then choose the appropriate locus and type of experience which this co-Creator or sub-sub-Logos you call so carelessly a person will take.

# Meditation
An activity where the focus of the mind is placed on [[Breathing]] or silence or a subject or an object.

The most common form is a sitting with leg crossed like Lotus Pose, Full Lotus.

The reason for Lotus Pose or Full Lotus is in [[LOO Pyramids]]
- I also suspect in Full Lotus position, one forms the pentagram with the legs with arms connecting the two feet. And in Tarot, pentagram signifies earth, thus sitting on ground and rock and meditate will boost one's energy most significantly?

Of course one can meditation simply by laying down.

49.8: Is it better, or shall I say, does it produce more usable results in meditation to leave the mind, shall I say, as blank as possible; let it run down, so to speak, or is it better to focus in meditation on some object or some thing for concentration?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This shall be the last full query of this work time.  
  
Each of the two types of meditation is useful for a particular reason. The passive meditation involving the clearing of the mind, the emptying of the mental jumble which is characteristic of mind complex activity among your peoples, is efficacious for those whose goal is to achieve an inner silence as a base from which to listen to the Creator. This is an useful and helpful tool and is by far the most generally useful type of meditation as opposed to contemplation or prayer.  
  
The type of meditation which may be called visualization has as its goal not that which is contained in the meditation itself. Visualization is the tool of the adept. Those who learn to hold visual images in mind are developing an inner concentrative power that can transcend boredom and discomfort. When this ability has become crystallized in an adept the adept may then do polarizing in consciousness without external action, which can affect the planetary consciousness. This is the reason for existence of the so-called White Magician. Only those wishing to pursue the conscious raising of planetary vibration will find visualization to be a particularly satisfying type of meditation.  
  
Contemplation or the consideration in a meditative state of an inspiring image or text is extremely useful also among your peoples, and the faculty of will called praying is also of a potentially helpful nature. Whether it is indeed an helpful activity depends quite totally upon the intentions and objects of the one who prays.

66.18: meditation is always an aid to [[Know Yourself|knowing the self]]

66.19: Is a vertical positioning of the spine useful or helpful in the meditative procedure?

**Ra:** I am Ra. It is somewhat helpful.

# Karma
A term we use to describe the unseen and all-balancing force of the universe.

12.29: An entity which acts in a consciously unloving manner in action with other beings can become karmically involved.
- "Oh, I am so mad at someone that I gonna make that person suffer." - The conscious thought of this will create karma as and a greater karma if the act of suffering is carried out.

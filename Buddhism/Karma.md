# Karma
A term we use to describe the unseen and all-balancing force of the universe.

12.29: An entity which acts in a consciously unloving manner in action with other beings can become karmically involved.
- "Oh, I am so mad at someone that I gonna make that person suffer." - The conscious thought of this will create karma as and a greater karma if the act of suffering is carried out.

34.4: Our understanding of karma is that which may be called inertia. Those actions which are put into motion will continue using the ways of balancing until such time as the controlling or higher principle which you may liken unto your braking or stopping is invoked. This stoppage of the inertia of action may be called [[Forgiveness-Reconciliation|forgiveness]]. These two concepts are inseparable.

34.5: If an entity develops what is called a karma in an incarnation, is there then programming that sometimes occurs so that he will experience catalyst that will enable him to get to a point of forgiveness thereby alleviating the karma?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is, in general, correct. However, both self and any involved other-self may, at any time through the process of understanding, acceptance, and forgiveness, ameliorate these patterns. This is true at any point in an incarnative pattern. Thus one who has set in motion an action may forgive itself and never again make that error. This also brakes or stops what you call karma.

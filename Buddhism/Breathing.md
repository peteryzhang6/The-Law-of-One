# Breathing
The act in which the inward and outward forces of the Infinite Creator or [[duality]] is present.

As we breath in, the air in the outside shrinks and our lungs expands. 

As we breath out, the air in the outside expands and our lungs shrink.

Thus unity is realized in 3D when one realizes the totality is ever the same but an constant changing of forms - of CO2 to O2 and O2 to CO2 - of plants and animals.

	- color would be a whiteness which contains a "golden" quality (schizo: the profile pic I used for Bananafloatie on Reddit lol, an entity of 6D STO in a 3to4D larger infinity, maybe a 6D STO in 4D ascending into 5D?? I dont know which density I am, it is hard to look at when I feel my mind is clogged sometimes)
	- a density to observe in an unified understanding of compassion with wisdom 
	- golden color is not of your spectrum but is what you would call alive
- 41.5
	- Some 6D entities, whose means of reproduction is fusion, may choose to perform this portion of experience as part of the beingness of the sun body
	- May think of portions of the light that you receive as offspring of the generative expression of sixth-density love 
	- 41.6 this is a way for sixth density beings to be more closely co-Creators with the Infinite Creator
	- 43.15 it is quite correct to say that sixth-density harvest is strictly social memory complex
- 59.3
	- **the work of sixth density is to unify wisdom and compassion**

# personal understanding/distortion
at the end of 6D STS, one of the must learned lesson, I think, is that of forgiveness/reconcilation. To recall and understand the heartless action of oneself did to other selves and to feel the pain of others as self; to deal and resolve the pain of others as self; to feel the pain caused by the heartless actions of other to self; to deal and resolve the pain that felt by others of knowing their heartless actions through self; and so on and on.

#6/7 You will remember the exercise of the wind. The dissolution into nothingness is the dissolution into unity, for there is no nothingness. From the sixth dimension, we are capable of manipulating, by thought, the intelligent infinity present in each particle of light or distorted light so that we were able to clothe ourselves in a replica visible in the third density of our mind/body/spirit complexes in the sixth density. We were allowed this experiment by the [[Council]] which guards this planet.

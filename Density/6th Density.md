That of Law of One

33.20: The sixth density of a whiteness which contains a golden quality as you would perceive it; these colors having to do with the blending into wisdom of the compassion learned in fourth density, then in sixth the blending of wisdom back into an unified understanding of compassion viewed with wisdom. This golden color is not of your spectrum but is what you would call alive.

- 41.5
	- Some 6D entities, whose means of reproduction is fusion, may choose to perform this portion of experience as part of the beingness of the sun body
	- May think of portions of the light that you receive as offspring of the generative expression of sixth-density love 
	- 41.6 this is a way for sixth density beings to be more closely co-Creators with the Infinite Creator
	- 43.15 it is quite correct to say that sixth-density harvest is strictly social memory complex
- 59.3
	- **the work of sixth density is to unify wisdom and compassion**

32.6: The indigo ray is the ray of, shall we say, awareness of the Creator as self; thus one whose indigo-ray vibrations have been activated can offer the energy transfer of Creator to Creator. This is the beginning of the sacramental nature of what you call your bisexual reproductive act. It is unique in bearing the allness, the wholeness, the unity in its offering to other-self.
# personal understanding/distortion
at the end of 6D STS, one of the must learned lesson, I think, is that of forgiveness/reconcilation. To recall and understand the heartless action of oneself did to other selves and to feel the pain of others as self; to deal and resolve the pain of others as self; to feel the pain caused by the heartless actions of other to self; to deal and resolve the pain that felt by others of knowing their heartless actions through self; and so on and on.

6.7: You will remember the exercise of the wind. The dissolution into nothingness is the dissolution into unity, for there is no nothingness. From the sixth dimension, we are capable of manipulating, by thought, the intelligent infinity present in each particle of light or distorted light so that we were able to clothe ourselves in a replica visible in the third density of our mind/body/spirit complexes in the sixth density. We were allowed this experiment by the [[Council]] which guards this planet.

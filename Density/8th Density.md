# 8th Density
<- [[7th Density]] | [[1st Density]] ->

1st density of next octave
- 52.12
	- is both omega and alpha; the spiritual mass of the infinite universes becoming one central sun or Creator once again
	- Then is born a new universe, a new infinity, a new Logos which incorporates all that the Creator has experienced of Itself
	- light-bringers from the octave 

11.8: However, a few have penetrated the eighth level which is only available from the opening up of the seventh through the sixth. Penetration into the eighth or intelligent infinity level allows a mind/body/spirit complex to be harvested if it wishes at any time/space during the cycle.

(28.15) the eighth density functions also as the beginning density or first density, in its latter stages, of the next octave of densities.

34.2: You stated at an earlier time that penetration of the eighth level or intelligent infinity level allows a mind/body/spirit complex to be harvested if it wishes at any time/space during the cycle. When this penetration of the eighth level occurs what does the entity who penetrates this experience? Can you tell me this?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. The experience of each entity is unique in perception of intelligent infinity. Perceptions range from a limitless joy to a strong dedication to service to others while in the incarnated state. The entity which reaches intelligent infinity most often will perceive this experience as one of unspeakable profundity. However, it is not usual for the entity to immediately desire the cessation of the incarnation. Rather the desire to communicate or use this experience to aid others is extremely strong.

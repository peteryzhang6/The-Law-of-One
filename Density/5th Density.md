16.41: At what point in densities is it necessary for an entity to be consciously aware of the Law of One to progress? - The fifth-density harvest is of those whose vibratory distortions consciously accept the honor/duty of the Law of One. This responsibility/honor is the foundation of this vibration.

25.11: The fifth density is the density of light or wisdom. The so-called negative service-to-self entity in this density is at an high level of awareness and wisdom and has ceased activity except by thought. The fifth-density negative is extraordinarily compacted and separated from all else.

33.20: color would be extremely white in vibration

- density of light and wisdom (wisdom = power, power = light from Thoth)
	- wisdom = neutral term
	- power = negative term in general current societal understanding
	- light = positive term in general current societal understanding

43.20: the vehicle needs food which may be prepared by thought.

43.21: You would call this type of food nectar, or ambrosia, or a light broth of golden white hue.

43.22: What is the purpose of ingesting food in fifth density?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is a somewhat central point. The purpose of space/time is the increase in catalytic action appropriate to the density. One of the preconditions for space/time existence is some form of body complex. Such a body complex must be fueled in some way.

43.23: Then, there is aâ€” In third density the fueling of our bodily complex is not only simply fuels the complex but but gives us opportunities to learn service. In fourth density it not only fuels the complex but gives us opportunities to learn patience. In fifth density it fuels the complex but does it teach?

**Ra:** I am Ra. In fifth density it is comfort, for those of like mind gather together to share in this broth, thus becoming one in light and wisdom while joining hearts and hands in physical activity. Thus in this density it becomes a solace rather than a catalyst for learning.

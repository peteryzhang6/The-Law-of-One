# 3rd Density
<- [[2nd Density]] | [[4th Density]] ->

13.21: Density of [[self-consciousness]] or self-awareness. ... The first density of consciousness of spirit.

16.39: It is absolutely necessary that an entity consciously realize it does not understand in order for it to be harvestable. Understanding is not of this density.
- 16.40: it was not necessary for an entity to be consciously aware of the Law of One to go from third to fourth density

76.15 The 3rd density is a choice 

76.16 The prelude to choice must encompass the laying of the foundation, the establishment of the illusion and the viability of that which can be made spiritually viable. The remainder of the densities is continuous refining of the choice. This also is greatly lengthened, as you would use the term. The choice is, as you put it, the work of a moment but is the axis upon which the creation turns.

82.17 The nature of third density is constant. Its ways are to be learned the same now and ever. Thusly, no matter what form the entity facing these lessons, the lessons and mechanisms are the same. The Creator will learn from Itself. Each entity has unmanifest portions of learning and, most importantly, learning which is involved with other-selves.

# Earth's 3D
6.15: **Ra:** One major cycle is approximately twenty-five thousand (25,000) of your years. There are three cycles of this nature during which those who have progressed may be harvested. At the end of three major cycles, that is, approximately between seventy-five and seventy-six thousand (75–76,000) of your years, all are harvested regardless of their progress, for during that time the planet itself has moved through the useful part of that dimension and begins to cease being useful for the lower levels of vibration within that density.

10.6: Not only do we have entities from [[Maldek]] and [[Mars]], There are entities experiencing your time/space continuum who have originated from many, many places, as you would call them, in the creation, for when there is a cycle change, those who must repeat then find a planetary sphere appropriate for this repetition. It is somewhat unusual for a planetary mind/body/spirit complex to contain those from many, many, various loci, but this explains much, for, you see, you are experiencing the third-dimensional occurrence with a large number of those who must repeat the cycle. The orientation, thus, has been difficult to unify even with the aid of many of your teach/learners.
# Aid of 3D Earth
14.4: 

The first attempt to aid your peoples was at the time seven five oh oh oh (75,000). This attempt seventy-five thousand (75,000) of your years ago has been previously described by us. The next attempt was approximately five eight oh oh oh, fifty-eight thousand (58,000) of your years ago, continuing for a long period in your measurement, with those of Mu as you call this race or mind/body/spirit social complex. The next attempt was long in coming and occurred approximately thirteen thousand (13,000) of your years ago when some intelligent information was offered to those of [[Atlantis]], this being of the same type of healing and crystal working of which we have spoken previously. The next attempt was one one oh oh oh, eleven thousand (11,000), of your years ago. These are approximations as we are not totally able to process your space/time continuum measurement system. This was in what you call [[Egypt]] and of this we have also spoken. The same beings which came with us returned approximately three five oh oh (3,500) years later in order to attempt to aid the South American mind/body/spirit social complex once again. However, the pyramids of those so-called cities were not to be used in the appropriate fashion.
- 14.5 We of the vibratory sound complex, Ra, have walked among you only at that time. (11,000 years ago in Egpyt)

Therefore, this was not pursued further. There was a landing approximately three oh oh oh, three thousand (3,000), of your years ago also in your South America, as you call it. There were a few attempts to aid your peoples approximately two three oh oh (2,300) years ago, this in the area of Egypt. The remaining part of the cycle, we have never been gone from your fifth dimension and have been working in this last minor cycle to prepare for harvest.

14.8: All of these visits for the last 75,000 years were for the purpose of giving to the people of Earth an understanding of the Law of One, and this way allow them to progress upward through the fourth, fifth, sixth densities. This was to be a service to Earth. The pyramids were used also in giving the Law of One in their own way.
# First entities of Earth 3D
9.6: The first of those to come here were brought from another planet in your solar system called by you the Red Planet, [[Mars]]. This planet’s environment became inhospitable to third-density beings. The first entities, therefore, were of this race, as you may call it, manipulated somewhat by those who were guardians at that time.
- 9.11: this transfer occurred approximately seven five zero zero zero (75,000) years ago.

9.7: The race is a combination of the mind/body/spirit complexes of those of your so-called Red Planet and a careful series of genetical adjustments made by the guardians of that time. These entities arrived, or were preserved, for the experience upon your sphere by a type of birthing which is non-reproductive, but consists of preparing genetic material for the incarnation of the mind/body/spirit complexes of those entities from the Red Planet.
- 9.8: the guardians transferred the race here after the race had died from the physical as we know it on Mars

9.9: The Law of One was named by these guardians as the bringing of the wisdom of the guardians in contact with the entities from the Red Planet, thus melding the social memory complex of the guardian race and the Red Planet race. It, however, took an increasing amount of distortion into the application of the Law of One from the viewpoint of other guardians and it is from this beginning action that the quarantine of this planet was instituted, for it was felt that the free will of those of the Red Planet had been abridged.

9.10: The entities of the Red Planet were attempting to learn the Laws of Love which form one of the primal distortions of the Law of One. However, the tendencies of these people towards bellicose actions caused such difficulties in the atmospheric environment of their planet that it became inhospitable for third-density experience before the end of its cycle. Thus, the Red Planet entities were unharvested and continued in your illusion to attempt to learn the Law of Love.

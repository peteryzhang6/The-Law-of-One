#TODO 

A [[symbol]] of a snake biting on its tail to form a circle.

In general, it represents eternity.

I also understood it as the mind or conscious becomes self-conscious.

The act of snake biting on its tail will be some pain, as in one becomes knowing of its past selves and actions, it is inevitable to find pain during the time of unknowing, of ignorant, of innocence.

To eat the tail is an act of digesting the pain?

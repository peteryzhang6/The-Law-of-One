[Wiki - Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)

A circular symbol that depicts a snake or dragon devouring its own tail and that is used especially to represent the eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth.

I also understood it as the mind or conscious becomes self-conscious. I choose the image because the tree in the center represents the tree of life.

The act of snake biting on its tail will be some pain, as in one becomes knowing of its past selves and actions, it is inevitable to find pain during the time of unknowing, of ignorant, of innocence.

To eat the tail is an act of digesting the pain?

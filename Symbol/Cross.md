#TODO 

A major symbol of [[Christianity]].

Like one of the spiritual person said:

The Cross is a metaphysical representation of light and love. The vertical represents one's ability to rise to highest heaven and descend to lowest hell. The horizontal represents the infinite possibility of one's potential in light and love. The point where vertical and horizontal meet represents the true self.

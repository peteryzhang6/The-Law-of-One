# Service to Other
Check [[STO-STS]]

The STO will need STS when the self is in danger as STS is best known for its ability to preserve the self.

7.15: However, service to others results in service to self, thus preserving and further harmonizing the distortions of those entities seeking intelligent infinity through these disciplines.

15.7: **The greatest service that our population on this planet(Earth) can perform individually** - There is but one service. The Law is One. The offering of self to Creator is the greatest service, the unity, the fountainhead. The entity who seeks the One Creator is with infinite intelligence. From this seeking, from this offering, a great multiplicity of opportunities will evolve depending upon the mind/body/spirit complexes’ distortions with regard to the various illusory aspects or energy centers of the various complexes of your illusion. Thus, some become healers, some workers, some teachers, and so forth.

17.30: are there best ways of being of service to others?
- The best way of service to others is the constant attempt to seek to share the love of the Creator as it is known to the inner self. This involves self knowledge and the ability to open the self to the other-self without hesitation. This involves, shall we say, radiating that which is the essence or the heart of the mind/body/spirit complex.  
- Speaking to the intention of your question, the best way for each seeker in third density to be of service to others is unique to that mind/body/spirit complex. This means that the mind/body/spirit complex must then seek within itself the intelligence of its own [[discernment]] as to the way it may best serve other-selves. This will be different for each. There is no best. There is no generalization. Nothing is known.

32.1: Thus we see protection being very simple. Give thanksgiving for each moment. See the self and the other-self as Creator. Open the heart. Always know the light and praise it. This is all the protection necessary.
- 33.2: Harmony, thanksgiving, and praise of opportunities and of the Creator: these are your protection.

52.3: I would ask this question in order to understand the mental disciplines and how they evolve. Do fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-density positive or service-to-others orientation social memory complexes use both the slingshot and the personality discipline type of effect for travel or do they use only one?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The positively oriented social memory complex will be attempting to learn the disciplines of mind, body, and spirit. However, there are some which, having the technology available to use intelligent energy forces to accomplish travel, do so while learning the more appropriate disciplines.

52.4: Then I am assuming in the positively oriented social memory complexes that a much higher percentage of them use the personality disciplines for this travel. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct. As positive fifth density moves into sixth there are virtually no entities which any longer use outer technology for travel or communication.

54.21: A positively oriented entity may select a certain narrow path of thinking and activities during an incarnation and program conditions that would create physical pain if this path were not followed. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.
# How should STO treat STS
44.10: Can you suggest a method whereby we might, shall I say, nullify the effect of the influence that we don’t want from a negative source?

**Ra:** I am Ra. There are various methods. We shall offer the most available or simple. To share the difficult contact with the other-selves associated with this working and to meditate in love for these senders of images and light for self and other-selves is the most available means of nullifying the effects of such occurrences. To downgrade these experiences by the use of intellect or the disciplines of will is to invite the prolonging of the effects. Far better then to share in trust such experiences and join hearts and souls in love and light with compassion for the sender and armor for the self.

Like Ra said, with Love and Light.

*Thoughts:*

It is difficult to treat STSs with Love and Light as an initiate of STOs, but to understand and in knowing of that STS will eventually end in 6D and turn to 6D STO: for those (STSs) who use me to their own gain, I worry not. For I know the road they walk is one of dead ends, of death For I have travelled that path many times. So I help them and accelerate their journey that has an end. I shall help them to progress their journey and fast shall I accelerate their journey that within moments do they reach their destination. Oh how much do they celebrate at me surrendering at their power, but oh so foolishly do they believe that the road they walk is one to eternal life. I wait, wait till the day they reach their final destination. And it is called "final destination" for a reason, the "final" is the end of their road, of their life, of all their "achievements" they so dearly hold on to. It is nothing but an illusion, for they chose to walk the road of illusion and thus do they met the end of illusion - The Final, the Death, for Final Death is also an merely illusion that exists in the all wisdom and love of Infinity. And then do I see they turn and walk the path of truth, the one that I never left and neither did they. LOL #infinity #unity #foreverness
- To walk the the path of "falseness" and return to the path of Truth is the display of the power of infinity intelligence to create a plane of existence where the distortion of "falseness" exists and allow the beings to experience such "falseness" through the veil of forgetting of one self's perfection and walk the journey to return to source or to eternity.
	- In order words, this can be understood in Christian terms of "why did God create hell or evil?" For God is all powerful and all knowing, thus for a being born in heaven and to further understanding its own perfection within the universe, did God create "hell" or "imperfection" and through the Law of Free Will, the being chooses to put itself through the illusion/distortion of "hell", of "imperfection" to better understand the perfection or God. #Christianity
	- Because of the Law of Free Will and the Veil of Forgetfulness, one may get lost in the illusion and distortion and misses the time to return to heaven and gets trapped in the illusion of self or the self distortion. Thus further manifests and strengthens the illusion, thus the heavenly beings, or elders come into the illusion to "free" the "trapped" beings, thus causes the Messiah/savior Complex to the beings coming in due the veil of forgetfulness and gets caught up in the maelstrom of the karma of the trapped beings. 
	- The desire of beings to "save" the trapped ones within the illusion is also a display of the infinity intelligence to create a plane of existence where the distortion of "saving", "freeing", and/or "healing" other selves exists. Although All is One and One is All at all time and space, the desire to "save" or "healing" can be seen as an desire or experiment to accelerate the progression of beings from 1D to 7D. Or an desire to increase the frequency of vibration. A worldly example can be seen as the desire to turn up the volume to music to further experience the joy within the music, yet the volume has a upper limit to the one experiencing as too high of a volume can cause permanent damage to the ears of one. Thus the same can also be applied back to the desire/distortion of "healing/patient". #healing-patient A common saying of "experiment and play around (with the object) and push the boundaries and limits of the understanding of oneself."
	- The gap between the healing and patient creates the illusion of time and space. As one closes this gap or unites and balances the pain and joy within oneself, one will bring oneself out of the illusion of time and space (As Ra said that their polarity is united thus they are not of time and space). And as one gets to perfect unity of oneself, one will start to move out of the cycle of life and death (As Ra said the Law of One reaches for the Law of Foreverness; 6D to 7D).
	- The act of piercing the veil of forgetfulness is an act of one using its own conscious to reflect upon the past/future experiences and to connect them to create a full circle, like the symbol [[Ouroboros]]. Then as one continues to reflect upon its experiences and unite the pain and joy, the positive polarity with the negative polarity, one's consciousness will start to grow and eventually allows oneself to piercing the veil and remember the perfection within oneself. Like the symbol of the sun ☉. The dot can be seen as the first circle created or the birth of ouroboros, and as it grows, it will reach the outer circle, thus the full piercing of the veil.

A change in sound, like from calm to anger, can signal an attack by negative polarity.

62.1: Could you tell me what was wrong or what caused the necessity for the re-walking of the circle and the purpose of the expelling of breath?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This instrument was under specific psychic attack at the time of the beginning of the working. There was a slight irregularity in the words verbalized by your sound complex vibratory mechanisms in the protective walking of the circle. Into this opening came this entity and began to work upon the instrument now in trance state, as you would call it. This instrument was being quite adversely affected in physical complex distortions.

62.23: **:** Isn’t this unusual that a fifth-density then would bother to do this rather than sending a fourth-density servant, shall I say?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct. Nearly all positive channels and groups may be lessened in their positivity or rendered quite useless by what we may call the temptations offered by the fourth-density negative thought-forms. They may suggest many distortions towards specific information, towards the aggrandizement of the self, towards the flowering of the organization in some political, social, or fiscal way.  
  
These distortions remove the focus from the One Infinite Source of love and light of which we are all messengers, humble and knowing that we, of ourselves, are but the tiniest portion of the Creator, a small part of a magnificent entirety of infinite intelligence.

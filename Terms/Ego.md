A function of mind in the form of "to be something":
- I am the greatest.

- I am a male.
- I am a boy.
- I am a female.
- I am a lady.

- I am the Devil.
- I am the Chosen One.

- He is...
- She is...
- It is...

- You are...

To view ego under the lens of Law of One's 7 densities, we can breakdown the idea of ego, of "to be something" or ex: "I am One" as:
- "To/I": 1D - subconsciousness or the intelligent infinity or the potential (dormant) energy come into conscious being
- "Be/am": 2D - consciousness start to move and explore its options
- "Something/One": 3D - choice of what the consciousness want to be or to become
- 4D is the discovery and refinery of compassion and love of the choice of 3D
- 5D is the discovery and refinery of light and wisdom of the choice of 3D
- 6D is the fusion and uniting of love/compassion from 4D and light/wisdom from 5D
- The progress from 4D to 6D is the continuous refinement of the 3D choice
- 7D is the accomplishment of the choice or goal achieved. The consciousness merges back into the subconsciousness of The Infinite Creator and becomes the potential for 8D
- 8D or 1D of the next octave is the rise of new consciousness of "To/I" from the potential of 7D of previous octave

With the Law of One's understanding, I can redefine the meaning of ego as
- a process of the potential infinite intelligence coming into light then into unity
- a process of the unconscious mind coming into light; become conscious; consciously draw upon the potential or the unconscious mind to shine brighter or vibrate in a higher frequency; finally unite again into the Infinite Creator.

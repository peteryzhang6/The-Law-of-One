# Polarization
Polarization can be divided into 2 categories:
- negative polarity - service to self (STS)
- positive polarity - service to other (STO)
- Please check [STO-STS](STO-STS.md)
# Polarization for [[Harvest]]
A STS will need to achieve a 95% or more polarization towards the self.
- A grade of at most 5 towards service to others
- or A grade of at least 95 towards service to self

A STO will need to achieve a 50% or more polarization toward others.
- A grade of at least 50 towards service to others
- Or a grade of at most towards service to self

17.31: In the book *[[Oahspe]]* it states that if an individual is more than fifty percent for others— that is, goes over the 50% service to others, and is less than fifty percent for service to self, then he is harvestable.
- Correct if the harvesting is to be for the positive fourth dimensional level

17.32: The entity who wishes to pursue the path of service to self must attain a grade of five, that is five percent service to others, ninety-five percent service to self. It must approach totality. The negative path is quite difficult to attain harvestability upon and requires great dedication.

17.33: Why is the negative path so much more difficult a path to attain harvestability upon than the positive?
- This is due to a distortion of the Law of One which indicates that the gateway to intelligent infinity be a gateway at the end of a strait and narrow path as you may call it. To attain fifty-one percent dedication to the welfare of other-selves is as difficult as attaining a grade of five percent dedication to other-selves. The, shall we say, sinkhole of indifference is between those two.

For each polarity, the maximum potential can be achieved is 99%.
- for STS, the 1% left or outside of the self is to provide energy for the self to take
- for STO, the 1% left or held within the self is to provide energy to serve other selves
- If STS or STO were to achieve 100%, then STS and STO will no longer have polarity but united with the Infinite Creator

The prerequisite for an entity to polarize to STS or STO is the knowing of the conscious or becoming self-conscious. The birth of self-conscious can also be understood as the creation of [Ego](Ego.md).
At the point of becoming self-conscious, an entity's polarization is determined by the memories it can consciously remember.
As the entity examines its memories - its past selves or past actions, the entity is able to separate or categorize the past selves and actions into yin and yang:
- the yin is actions that are STS
- the yang is actions that are STO

Use the example provided in [Smart-Stupid](Smart-Stupid.md):
- To choose to polarize to yang or STO:
	- observe the memories of yin and consciously turn it into an action of yin/yang
	- observe the memories of yang and consciously continue so - yang/yang
- To choose to polarize to yin or STS:
	- observe the memories of yang and consciously turn it into an action of yang/yin
	- observe the memories of yin and consciously continue so - yin/yin

To know that infinity exists within all, thus even when an entity of STS or STO achieves 99%, the 1% infinity can still be more than that of 99% of one.

Thus Ra states that the path of STS will come to an end because the gravity of oneself is so strong and the desire to consume will be overwhelmed by the inpouring of only 1% of infinity from other selves. Thus the turning of 6D STS to 6D STO can be seen as an explosion of overwhelming fuel poured into the furnace that the furnace cannot handle the pressure within thus causes an explosion, of turning the desire to consume to desire of provide.
- to use another example: One eat all the delicious food from others, but still needs to poop. This poop is the unwilling force of giving back to nature. 
- [The last straw broke the camel's back](The%20last%20straw%20broke%20the%20camel's%20back)- not to say the camel is the STS but the carelessness of the person who put that last straw onto camel's back is a selfish one and with the death of the camel so do the person. Thus the STS achieves unity through the complete destruction of self.

Thus Ra states that the path of STO will be one of that infinite as one refines its understanding on unity and infinity, the 1% or how many percent within oneself to take from others will become more efficient at giving.

11.20: There are two main ways, just as there are two main ways of, shall we say, polarizing towards service to others. There are those mind/body/spirit complexes upon your plane who do exercises and perform disciplines in order to seek contact with sources of information and power leading to the opening of the gate to intelligent infinity. There are others whose vibratory complex is such that this gateway is opened and contact with total service to self with its primal distortion of manipulation of others is then afforded with little or no difficulty, no training, and no control.

19.18: The further an entity has, what you would call, polarized, the more easily this entity may change polarity, for the more power and awareness the entity will have.  
- Those truly helpless are those who have not consciously chosen but who repeat patterns without knowledge of the repetition or the meaning of the pattern.
- 19.19: It then seems that there is an extreme potential in this polarization the same as there is in— to make an analogy, using electricity: We have a positive and negative pole. The more you build the charge on either of these, the greater the potential difference and the greater the ability to do work, as we call it, in the physical.

21.20: What is necessary to balance is opportunity. When there is ignorance, there is no opportunity. When there exists a potential, then each opportunity shall be balanced, this balancing caused by not only the positive and negative orientations of those offering aid but also the orientation of those requesting aid.

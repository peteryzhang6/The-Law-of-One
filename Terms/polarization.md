# Polarization
Polarization can be divided into 2 categories:
- negative polarity - service to self (STS)
- positive polarity - service to other (STO)
- Please check [STO-STS](STO-STS.md)

For each polarity, the maximum potential can be achieved is 99%.
- for STS, the 1% left or outside of the self is to provide energy for the self to take
- for STO, the 1% left or held within the self is to provide energy to serve other selves
- If STS or STO were to achieve 100%, then STS and STO will no longer have polarity but united with the Infinite Creator

The prerequisite for an entity to polarize to STS or STO is the knowing of the conscious or becoming self-conscious. The birth of self-conscious can also be understood as the creation of [Ego](Ego.md).
At the point of becoming self-conscious, an entity's polarization is determined by the memories it can consciously remember.
As the entity examines its memories - its past selves or past actions, the entity is able to separate or categorize the past selves and actions into yin and yang:
- the yin is actions that are STS
- the yang is actions that are STO

Use the example provided in [Smart-Stupid](Smart-Stupid.md):
- To choose to polarize to yang or STO:
	- observe the memories of yin and consciously turn it into an action of yin/yang
	- observe the memories of yang and consciously continue so - yang/yang
- To choose to polarize to yin or STS:
	- observe the memories of yang and consciously turn it into an action of yang/yin
	- observe the memories of yin and consciously continue so - yin/yin

To know that infinity exists within all, thus even when an entity of STS or STO achieves 99%, the 1% infinity can still be more than that of 99% of one.

Thus Ra states that the path of STS will come to an end because the gravity of oneself is so strong and the desire to consume will be overwhelmed by the inpouring of only 1% of infinity from other selves. Thus the turning of 6D STS to 6D STO can be seen as an explosion of overwhelming fuel poured into the furnace that the furnace cannot handle the pressure within thus causes an explosion, of turning the desire to consume to desire of provide.
- to use another example: One eat all the delicious food from others, but still needs to poop. This poop is the unwilling force of giving back to nature. 
- [The last straw broke the camel's back](The%20last%20straw%20broke%20the%20camel's%20back)- not to say the camel is the STS but the carelessness of the person who put that last straw onto camel's back is a selfish one and with the death of the camel so do the person. Thus the STS achieves unity through the complete destruction of self.

Thus Ra states that the path of STO will be one of that infinite as one refines its understanding on unity and infinity, the 1% or how many percent within oneself to take from others will become more efficient at giving. 

11.20: There are two main ways, just as there are two main ways of, shall we say, polarizing towards service to others. There are those mind/body/spirit complexes upon your plane who do exercises and perform disciplines in order to seek contact with sources of information and power leading to the opening of the gate to intelligent infinity. There are others whose vibratory complex is such that this gateway is opened and contact with total service to self with its primal distortion of manipulation of others is then afforded with little or no difficulty, no training, and no control.

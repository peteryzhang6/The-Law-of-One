# Law of Love
Can also be called the Way of Love.

27.11: The second [[Primal Distortion]] of Law of One.

# Definition
27.12: What is Love?
- This must be defined against the background of intelligent infinity or unity or the One Creator with the primal distortion of free will. The term Love then may be seen as the focus, the choice of attack, the type of energy of an extremely, shall we say, high order which causes intelligent energy to be formed from the potential of intelligent infinity in just such and such a way. This then may be seen to be an object rather than an activity by some of your peoples, and the principle of this extremely strong energy focus being worshiped as the Creator instead of unity or oneness from which all Loves emanate. 

*Thoughts on 27.12*: Think of intelligent infinity/energy as the Matrix in Tarot, then Love is the Potentiator, then Light is the Catalyst. And from the three, trinity, birth infinite possibility/opportunity.

27.13: Is Love— is there a manifestation of love that we could call vibration?
- The vibration or density of love or understanding is not a term used in the same sense as the second distortion, Love; the distortion Love being the great activator and primal co-Creator of various creations using intelligent infinity; the vibration love being that density in which those who have learned to do an activity called “loving” without significant distortion, then seek the ways of light or wisdom. Thus in vibratory sense love comes into light in the sense of the activity of unity in its free will. Love uses light and has the power to direct light in its distortions. Thus vibratory complexes recapitulate in reverse the creation in its unity, thus showing the rhythm or flow of the great heartbeat, if you will use this analogy.

27.14: I will make a statement that I have extracted from the physics of Dewey Larson which may or may not be close to what we are trying to explain. Larson says that all is motion which we can take as vibration, and that vibration, which is pure vibration and is not physical in any way or in any form or in any density; that vibration, by— first product of that vibration is what we call the photon, particle of light. I was trying to make an analogy between this physical solution and the concept of love and light. Is this close to the concept of Love creating light, or not?
- I am Ra. You are correct.

27.15: Then I will expand a bit more on this concept. We have the infinite vibration of Love which can occur, I am assuming, at varying frequencies, if this has a meaning in this; I would assume that it begins at one basic frequency. Does this have any meaning? Am I making sense? Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. Each Love, as you term the prime movers, comes from one frequency, if you wish to use this term. This frequency is unity. We would perhaps liken it rather to a strength than a frequency, this strength being infinite, the finite qualities being chosen by the particular nature of this primal movement.

27.16: Then this vibration which is, for lack of better understanding, which we would call pure motion; it is pure love; it is— it is not— there is nothing that is yet condensed, shall we say, to form any type or density of illusion. This Love then creates by this process of vibration a photon, as we call it, which is the basic particle of light. This photon then, by added vibrations and rotations, further condenses into particles of the densities, the various densities that we experience. Is this correct?
- I am Ra. This is correct.

27.17: Now, this— then light which forms the densities has what we call color, and this color is divided into seven categories of color. Can you tell me, is there is a reason or an explanation for these categories of color? Can you tell me something about that?
- The nature of the vibratory patterns of your universe is dependent upon the configurations placed upon the original material or light by the focus or Love using Its intelligent energy to create a certain pattern of illusions or densities in order to satisfy Its own intelligent estimate of a method of knowing Itself. Thus the colors, as you call them, are as strait, or narrow, or necessary as is possible to express, given the will of Love.

*Thoughts on 27.17:* This concept can be thought as the relationship and layering of [[Logos]] and its sub-Logos. 
- The first layer of Logos and sub-Logos: Logo being the Infinite Creator and through the Law of Free Will (Intelligent Infinity/energy) and Law of Love to create Light or physical materials of the galaxy our solar system in. 
- The second layer: Our galaxy acts as the co-Creator and within its own vibration/Love creates the Light/stars.
- The third layer: Our Sun acts as the co-co-Creator and within its own vibration/Love creates/attracts the planets.
	- 29.1: Our sun, as we know it, is a sub-Logos or the physical manifestation of a sub-Logos.
	- 29.2: The sub-Logos of your solar entity differentiated some experiential components within the patterns of intelligent energy set in motion by the Logos which created the basic conditions and vibratory rates consistent throughout your, what you have called, major galaxy.
- The fourth layer: The Earth acts as the co-co-co-Creator and within its own vibration/Love to create beings - animals, plants, minerals, humans, and so on. 
- The fifth layer: We act as the co-co-co-co-Creator and within our own vibration/Love are we able to observe the Light created by Sun. The 7 colors we see are a local configuration of the Sun and its Earth.
- 28.3: This light that occurred as a consequence of vibration which is a consequence of Love.
- 28.4: This light then can condense into material as we know it in our density, into all of our chemical elements because of rotations of the vibration at quantized intervals or units of angular velocity
- Also check [[TTC-Ch 1]]
- It is also to note that there might be layers missing in between due to the limitation of my own knowledge

29.12: As the Love creates the vibration— I will make this statement, first. Let me say, I believe that Love creates the vibration in space/time in order to form the photon. Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is essentially correct.

29.13: Then the continued application of Love— I will assume this is directed by a sub-Logos or a sub-sub-Logos— this continued application of Love creates rotations of these vibrations which are in discrete units of angular velocity. This then creates chemical elements in our physical illusion and I will assume the elements in the other or what we would call nonphysical or other densities in the illusion. Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. The Logos creates all densities. Your question was unclear. However, we shall state the Logos does create both the space/time densities and the accompanying time/space densities.
- 29.14: What I am assuming is that the rotations, the quantized incremental rotations of the vibrations show up as the material of these densities. Is this correct?
	- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is essentially correct.

28.2: "the nature of the vibratory patterns of your universe is dependent upon the configurations placed on the original material or light by the focus of Love using Its intelligent energy to create a certain pattern of… of illusions or densities.” Then after this material you said that there’s further information which you’d be happy to share, but we ran out of time. Could you complete the further information on that?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. In discussing this information we then, shall we say, snap back into the particular methods of understanding or seeing that which is that the one, sound vibration complex, Dewey, offers; this being correct for the second meaning of intelligent infinity: the potential which then through catalyst forms the kinetic.
- This information is a natural progression of inspection of the kinetic shape of your environment. You may understand each color or ray as being, as we had said, a very specific and accurate apportion of intelligent energy’s representation of intelligent infinity, each ray having been previously inspected in other regards.
- This information may be of aid here. We speak now nonspecifically to increase the depth of your conceptualization of the nature of what is. The universe in which you live is recapitulation in each part of intelligent infinity. Thus you will see the same patterns repeated in physical and metaphysical areas; the rays or apportions of light being, as you surmise, those areas of what you may call the physical illusion which rotate, vibrate, or are of a nature that may be, shall we say, counted or categorized in rotation manner in space/time as described by the one known as Dewey; some substances having various of the rays in a physical manifestation visible to the eye, this being apparent in the nature of your crystallized minerals which you count as precious, the ruby being red and so forth.

28.5: I am wondering, what is the catalyst or the activator of the rotation? What causes the rotation so that the light condenses into our physical or chemical elements?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. It is necessary to consider the enabling function of the focus known as Love. This energy is of an ordering nature. It orders in a cumulative way from greater to lesser so that when Its universe, as you may call it, is complete, the manner of development of each detail is inherent in the living light and thus will develop in such and such a way; your own universe having been well-studied in an empirical fashion by those you call your scientists and having been understood or visualized, shall we say, with greater accuracy by the understandings or visualizations of the one known as Dewey.

28.6: When does individualization or the individualized portion of consciousness come into play? How does this individualization occur and at what point does individualized consciousness take over in working on the basic light?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. You remain carefully in the area of creation itself. In this process we must further confuse you by stating that the process by which free will acts upon potential intelligent infinity to become focused intelligent energy takes place without the space/time of which you are so aware as it is your continuum experience.
- The experience or existence of space/time comes into being after the individuation process of Logos or Love has been completed and the physical universe, as you would call it, has coalesced or begun to draw inward while moving outward to the extent that that which you call your sun bodies have in their turn created timeless chaos coalescing into what you call planets, these vortices of intelligent energy spending a large amount of what you would call first density in a timeless state, the space/time realization being one of the learn/teachings of this density of beingness.
- Thus we have difficulty answering your questions with regard to time and space and their relationship to the, what you would call, original creation which is not a part of space/time as you can understand it.

28.8: Let’s take as an example the planet that we are on now and tell me how much of the creation was created by the same Logos that created this planet?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This planetary Logos is a strong Logos creating approximately two hundred fifty billion (250,000,000,000) of your star systems for Its creation. The, shall we say, laws or physical ways of this creation will remain, therefore, constant.
- 28.9: Then what you’re saying is that the lenticular star system which we call a galaxy that we find ourself in with approximately 250 billion other suns like our own was created by a single Logos.

28.10: Now, since there are many individualized portions of consciousness in this lenticular galaxy, did this Logos then subdivide into more individualization of consciousness to create these consciousness or divide into these consciousness?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. You are perceptive. This is also correct although an apparent paradox.
- *apparent paradox* - 28.11: It would seem that if one Logos creates the intelligent energy ways for a large system there would not be the necessity or possibility of the further sub-Logos differentiation. However, within limits, this is precisely the case, and it is perceptive that this has been seen.

28.13: Do all of the individualized portions of the Logos, then, in our— I’ll call the lenticular galaxy that we are in, 250 billion suns, or stars, I will call that the major galaxy just so we will not get mixed up in our terms. Does all the consciousness, then, in this individualized form that goes into what we are calling the major galaxy start out and go through all of the densities in order, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven or— then to eighth— or is there, shall I say, some who start higher up the rank and go in a— so that there is always a mixture of intelligent consciousness in the galaxy?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. The latter is more nearly correct. In each beginning there is the beginning from infinite strength. Free will acts as a catalyst. Beings begin to form the universes. Consciousness then begins to have the potential to experience. The potentials of experience are created as a part of intelligent energy and are fixed before experience begins.
- However, there is always, due to free will acting infinitely upon the creation, a great variation in initial responses to intelligent energy’s potential. Thus almost immediately the foundations of the, shall we call it, hierarchical nature of beings begins to manifest as some portions of consciousness or awareness learn through experience in a much more efficient manner.

28.14: Is there any reason for some portions being much more efficient in learning?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. Is there any reason for some to learn more quickly than others? Look, if you wish, to the function of the will … the, shall we say, attraction to the upward spiraling line of light.
- *Thoughts* - this has been answer in [[Learn-Teach]] - from other selves, one can accelerate its own rate of evolution of consciousness

28.18: When this major galaxy is formed by the Logos, polarity then exists in a sense that we have electrical polarity, a gravitational effect that probably isn’t polarity, I’m… I’ll have to ask that question… We do have electrical polarity existing at that time. Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. I accept this as correct with the stipulation that what you term electrical be understood as not only the one, Larson, stipulated its meaning but also in what you would call the metaphysical sense.

28.19: Are you saying then that we not only have a polarity of electrical charge but also a polarity in consciousness at that time?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct. All is potentially available from the beginning of your physical space/time; it then being the function of consciousness complexes to begin to use the physical materials to gain experience to then polarize in a metaphysical sense. The potentials for this are not created by the experiencer but by intelligent energy.

28.20: I am assuming that the process of creation, then, after the original creation of the major galaxy, is continued by the further individualization of consciousness of the Logos so that there are many, many portions of individualized consciousness then creating further items, you might say, for experience all over the galaxy. Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct, for within the, shall we say, guidelines or ways of the Logos, the sub-Logos may find various means of differentiating experiences without removing or adding to these ways.

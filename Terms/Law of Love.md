# Law of Love
Can also be called the Way of Love.

27.11: The second [[Primal Distortion]] of Law of One.

# Definition
27.12: What is Love?
- This must be defined against the background of intelligent infinity or unity or the One Creator with the primal distortion of free will. The term Love then may be seen as the focus, the choice of attack, the type of energy of an extremely, shall we say, high order which causes intelligent energy to be formed from the potential of intelligent infinity in just such and such a way. This then may be seen to be an object rather than an activity by some of your peoples, and the principle of this extremely strong energy focus being worshiped as the Creator instead of unity or oneness from which all Loves emanate. 

*Thoughts on 27.12*: Think of intelligent infinity/energy as the Matrix in Tarot, then Love is the Potentiator, then Light is the Catalyst. And from the three, trinity, birth infinite possibility/opportunity.

27.13: Is Love— is there a manifestation of love that we could call vibration?
- The vibration or density of love or understanding is not a term used in the same sense as the second distortion, Love; the distortion Love being the great activator and primal co-Creator of various creations using intelligent infinity; the vibration love being that density in which those who have learned to do an activity called “loving” without significant distortion, then seek the ways of light or wisdom. Thus in vibratory sense love comes into light in the sense of the activity of unity in its free will. Love uses light and has the power to direct light in its distortions. Thus vibratory complexes recapitulate in reverse the creation in its unity, thus showing the rhythm or flow of the great heartbeat, if you will use this analogy.

27.14: I will make a statement that I have extracted from the physics of Dewey Larson which may or may not be close to what we are trying to explain. Larson says that all is motion which we can take as vibration, and that vibration, which is pure vibration and is not physical in any way or in any form or in any density; that vibration, by— first product of that vibration is what we call the photon, particle of light. I was trying to make an analogy between this physical solution and the concept of love and light. Is this close to the concept of Love creating light, or not?
- I am Ra. You are correct.

27.15: Then I will expand a bit more on this concept. We have the infinite vibration of Love which can occur, I am assuming, at varying frequencies, if this has a meaning in this; I would assume that it begins at one basic frequency. Does this have any meaning? Am I making sense? Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. Each Love, as you term the prime movers, comes from one frequency, if you wish to use this term. This frequency is unity. We would perhaps liken it rather to a strength than a frequency, this strength being infinite, the finite qualities being chosen by the particular nature of this primal movement.

27.16: Then this vibration which is, for lack of better understanding, which we would call pure motion; it is pure love; it is— it is not— there is nothing that is yet condensed, shall we say, to form any type or density of illusion. This Love then creates by this process of vibration a photon, as we call it, which is the basic particle of light. This photon then, by added vibrations and rotations, further condenses into particles of the densities, the various densities that we experience. Is this correct?
- I am Ra. This is correct.

27.17: Now, this— then light which forms the densities has what we call color, and this color is divided into seven categories of color. Can you tell me, is there is a reason or an explanation for these categories of color? Can you tell me something about that?
- The nature of the vibratory patterns of your universe is dependent upon the configurations placed upon the original material or light by the focus or Love using Its intelligent energy to create a certain pattern of illusions or densities in order to satisfy Its own intelligent estimate of a method of knowing Itself. Thus the colors, as you call them, are as strait, or narrow, or necessary as is possible to express, given the will of Love.

*Thoughts on 27.17:* This concept can be thought as the relationship Logos and its sub-Logos. The first Logos being the original Unity (Intelligent Infinity/energy) and Love to create Light or physical materials of the solar system. Then our Sun (The co-creator or sub-Logos) acts as the unity (intelligent infinity/energy) and with Love (nuclear fusion) to create sunlight. And we as co-co-Creators, we see the sub-sub-Logos of the 7 colors.

# One Original Thought
#1-0 The Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator has only one important statement. That statement, my friends, as you know, is “All things, all of life, all of the creation is part of one original thought.”

What is the One Original Thought? 
- To look it at the top most view, can be seen as the Infinite Creator's one original thought - to know itself 
- to look it at different sub Logos, of a sub Logos to know itself within the creations of the Infinite Creator
- the 'loving' thought of to know itself creates self-awareness and consciousness

- "all things, all of life, all of the creation" can be seen as all there is in whatever form a being encounters.

#2/1 If one is illuminated, are not all illuminated?

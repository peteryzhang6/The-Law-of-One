# Galaxy
10.16 **Questioner:** Only one, other than what we can do to make the instrument more comfortable. I have only one other question. I would like to have brief information of the word you use, “galaxy.”

**Ra:** I am Ra. We use the term known to your people by the sound vibration complex “galaxy.” We accept that some galaxies contain one system of planetary and solar groups, others containing several. However, the importance of the locus in infinite time/space dimensionality is so little that we accept the distortion implicit in such an ambiguous term.

10.17 **Questioner:** Then would nine planets and our sun we have here in our system, would you refer to that as a solar galaxy?

**Ra:** We would not.

10.18 **Questioner:** How many stars, approximately, would be in a galaxy?

**Ra:** It depends upon the galactic system. Your own, as you know, contains many, many, millions of planet entities and star bodies.

# Galaxy
16.34: We use that (this) term in this sense as you would use star systems.
- 16.35: The galaxy term must be split. We call galaxy that vibrational complex that is local. Thus, your sun is what we would call the center of a galaxy. We see you have another meaning for this term.

10.16 **Questioner:** Only one, other than what we can do to make the instrument more comfortable. I have only one other question. I would like to have brief information of the word you use, “galaxy.”
- **Ra:** I am Ra. We use the term known to your people by the sound vibration complex “galaxy.” We accept that some galaxies contain one system of planetary and solar groups, others containing several. However, the importance of the locus in infinite time/space dimensionality is so little that we accept the distortion implicit in such an ambiguous term.

10.17 **Questioner:** Then would nine planets and our sun we have here in our system, would you refer to that as a solar galaxy?
- **Ra:** We would not.

10.18 **Questioner:** How many stars, approximately, would be in a galaxy?
- **Ra:** It depends upon the galactic system. Your own, as you know, contains many, many, millions of planet entities and star bodies.

16.25: How man inhabited planets are there in our galaxy? - We are assuming that you intend all dimensions of consciousness or densities of awareness in this question. Approximately one-fifth of all planetary entities contain awareness of one or more densities. Some planetary spheres are hospitable only for certain densities. Your planetary sphere, for instance, is at this time hospitable to levels or densities one, two, three, and four.

16.26: Roughly how many total planets in this galaxy of stars that we’re in have aware life regardless of density?
- Ra: I am Ra. Approximately six seven, oh oh oh, oh oh oh (67,000,000).
- 16.27: A percentage seventeen for first density, a percentage twenty for second density, a percentage twenty-seven for third density, a percentage sixteen for fourth density, a percentage six for fifth density. The other information must be withheld. The free will of your future is not making this available. We shall speak on one item. There is a fairly large percentage, approximately thirty-five percent of the intelligent planets, which do not fit in the percentiles. These mysteries are of sixth and seventh density and are not available for our speaking.
- 16.28: this first five densities, have all of them progressed from third density by knowledge and application of the Law of One.
- 16.30: this is not a query to which we may speak given the Law of Confusion. We may say only that the negatively or self-service oriented planetary spheres are much fewer. To give you exact numbers would not be appropriate.

28.15: Now, as the major galaxy is created, and I am assuming all of its densities— I am assuming all— there are eight densities created when this major galaxy is created

30.16: Well then, could you generally say that as you get closer to the center of this major galactic system that there is a greater spiritual density, I’ll use the term, or that this general spiritual quality is advanced at that area?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This will be the last full question of this session as this instrument is somewhat uncomfortable. We do not wish to deplete the instrument.
- The spiritual density or mass of those more towards the center of your galaxy is known. However, this is due simply to the varying timelessness states during which the planetary spheres may coalesce, this process of space/time beginnings occurring earlier, shall we say, as you approach the center of the galactic spiral.

40.2: Our astronomers have noticed that the light from spiral galaxies is approximately seven times less than it should be, from their calculations of what their mass should be. I was just wondering if that was due to the increase of spiritual mass in the galaxies in what we call white dwarf stars?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is basically correct and is a portion of the way or process of creation’s cycle.

# Incarnation
10.9: In the scheme of the Creator, the first step of the mind/body/spirit totality/beingness is to place its mind/body/spirit complex distortion in the proper place of love/light. This is done to ensure proper healing of the complex and eventual attunement with the totality/beingness complex. This takes a very variable length of your time/space. After this is accomplished the experience of the cycle is dissolved and filtered until only the distillation of distortions in its pure form remains. At this time, the harvested mind/body/spirit totality/beingness evaluates the density needs of its beingness and chooses the more appropriate new environment for either a repetition of the cycle or a moving forward into the next cycle. This is the manner of the harvesting, guarded and watched over by many.
- 10.10: The mind/body/spirit totality/beingness is one with the Creator. There is no time/space distortion. Therefore, it is a matter of thinking the proper locus in the infinite array of time/spaces.

Incarnation is automatic in 3rd density until the green ray center is activated.
- 21.9: At some point in third density, the green-ray energy center becomes activated and at that point incarnation ceases to be automatic.
- 21.10: When incarnation ceases to become automatic, the entity can decide when he needs to reincarnate for the benefit of his own learning. He also select his parents.
# Past Incarnations/experiences
9.2 However, such information as this is carefully guarded by your mind/body/spirit being totality so that your present space/time experiences will be undiluted.

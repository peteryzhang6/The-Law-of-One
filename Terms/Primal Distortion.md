# Primal Distortion
These are last distortions to unite when a being raises from 6D to 7D or the first distortions created when a being raises from 7D to 1D of next octave, assuming the next octave have similar configuration to the current octave.

15.21: The first distortion, free will, finds focus. This is the second distortion known to you as Logos, the Creative Principle or Love. This intelligent energy thus creates a distortion known as Light. From these three distortions come many, many hierarchies of distortions, each having its own paradoxes to be synthesized, no one being more important than another.

- [[Law of Free Will]]
- [[Finity]]
- [[STO-STS|Service]]
- [[Learn-Teach]]
- [[Healer-Patient]]
- I would also consider the 7 densities as primal distortion due to the mention of (9.10) Laws of Love
	- 1D - Law of Being -> Distortion of Free Will
	- 2D - Law of Movement -> Distortion of Love
	- 3D - Law of Choice -> Distortion of Light
	- Through the combination of the first three distortions, gives birth to many hierarchies of distortion in 4D to 7D
	- 4D - Law of Love and Compassion
	- 5D - Law of Light and wisdom
	- 6D - Law of One
		- The blending of Love and Light in 5D to 6D creates Learn-Teach
	- 7D - Law of Foreverness
		- In moving from 6D to 7D, along with the lessons from 5D to 6D creates Healer-Patient
	- 8D - Law of Being of next octave

**7.15:** It should be noted, carefully pondered, and accepted, that the Law of One is available to any social memory complex which has decided to strive together for any seeking of purpose, be it service to others or service to self. The laws, which are the **primal distortions** of the Law of One, then are placed into operation and the illusion of space/time is used as a medium for the development of the results of those choices freely made. Thus all entities learn, no matter what they seek. All learn the same, some rapidly, some slowly.

*My Thoughts:* The primal distortions left unchecked within the individual and refined to the highest potential can be defined as a all devouring beast. The beast is free, due to Law of Free Will; is adaptive, due to its ability to learn; and is regenerative due to its heightened regeneration ability. The primal distortions disciplined and controlled with the conscious mind is one of the Godly abilities, of savior - the ability to set others free; to teach others what it knows; and the ability to heal.

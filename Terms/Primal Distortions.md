# Primal Distortions
These are last distortions to unite when a being raises from 6D to 7D or the first distortions created when a being raises from 7D to 1D of next octave, assuming the next octave have similar configuration to the current octave.

- [[Law of Free Will]]
	- **3.14:** There is a law which we believe to be one of the more significant primal distortions of the Law of One. That is the Law of Confusion. You have called this the Law of Free Will
- [[Learn-Teach]]
- [[Healer-Patient]]
	- **4.20:** One of the primal distortions of the Law of One is that of healing.

**7.15:** It should be noted, carefully pondered, and accepted, that the Law of One is available to any social memory complex which has decided to strive together for any seeking of purpose, be it service to others or service to self. The laws, which are the **primal distortions** of the Law of One, then are placed into operation and the illusion of space/time is used as a medium for the development of the results of those choices freely made. Thus all entities learn, no matter what they seek. All learn the same, some rapidly, some slowly.

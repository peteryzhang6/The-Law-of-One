# Mind/Body/Spirit Complex
- [[The Mind]]
- [[The Body]]
- [[The Spirit]]

# Definition
**30.2**

Ra: I am Ra. These terms are all simplistic descriptive terms which equal a complex of energy focuses; the body, as you call it, being the material of the density which you experience at a given space/time or time/space; this complex of materials being available for distortions of what you would call physical manifestation.

The mind is a complex which reflects the inpourings of the spirit and the up-pourings of the body complex. It contains what you know as feelings, emotions, and intellectual thoughts in its more conscious complexities. Moving further down the tree of mind we see the intuition which is of the nature of the mind more in contact or in tune with the total beingness complex. Moving down to the roots of mind we find the progression of consciousness which gradually turns from the personal to the racial memory, to the cosmic influxes, and thus becomes a direct contactor of that shuttle which we call the spirit complex.

This spirit complex is the channel whereby the inpourings from all of the various universal, planetary, and personal inpourings may be funneled into the roots of consciousness and whereby consciousness may be funneled to the gateway of intelligent infinity through the balanced intelligent energy of body and mind.

You will see by this series of definitive statements that mind, body, and spirit are inextricably intertwined and cannot continue, one without the other. Thus we refer to the mind/body/spirit complex rather than attempting to deal with them separately, for the work, shall we say, that you do during your experiences is done through the interaction of these three components, not through any one.
# Healing
4.20: Healing occurs when a mind/body/spirit complex realizes, deep within itself, the Law of One; that is, that there is no disharmony, no imperfection; that all is complete and whole and perfect. Thus, the intelligent infinity within this mind/body/spirit complex re-forms the illusion of body, mind, or spirit to a form congruent with the Law of One. #unity
- *my thoughts*: In year 2021-2024, I said multiple times to my parents one of my realizations about depression is that "You can't save those who don't want to be saved." Thus I understand the healer is an energizer or catalyst for the patient, as I was a patient and did not have the intention to heal and the doctors and medicines cannot really help me. The healer does not heal but instead let the patient to realize the potential of healing within itself. Thus the healer see the Creator within the other self, like [[Jesus#John 14 6]] realized the inner perfection or The Law of One within himself, thus allowed him to see the perfection within other selves - the patients, thus when the patients came to Jesus, Jesus didn't heal them but said "Through your belief in me, thus you are healed" and the patients were healed. Because the patients saw perfection in Jesus, and Jesus returned the perfection by letting them know they are perfect too. It is funny this excerpt in on 4 20 lmao. 
- 5.1: It is not by example that the healer does the working. The working exists in and of itself. The healer is only the catalyst, much as this instrument has the catalysis necessary to provide the channel for our words, yet by example or exercise of any kind can take no thought for this working.
	- The healing working is congruent in that it is a form of channeling some distortion of the intelligent infinity.

#6/10 At one time/space, in what is your past, there was a population of third-density beings upon a planet which dwelt within your solar system. There are various names by which this planet has been named. The vibratory sound complex most usually used by your peoples is Maldek. These entities, destroying their planetary sphere, thus were forced to find room for themselves upon this third density which is the only one in your solar system at their time/space present which was hospitable and capable of offering the lessons necessary to decrease their mind/body/spirit distortions with respect to the Law of One.

#6/11/0 **Questioner:** How did they come here?

#6/11/1 **Ra:** They came through the process of harvest and were incarnated through the processes of incarnation from your higher spheres within this density.

#6/12/0 **Questioner:** How long ago did this happen in our years?

#6/12/2 This occurred approximately five hundred thousand [500,000] of your years ago.

#6/13/0 **Questioner:** Thanks. Is all of the Earth’s population then, human population of the earth, are all of them originally from Maldek?

#6/13/1 **Ra:** I am Ra. This is a new line of questioning, and deserves a place of its own. The ones who were harvested to your sphere from the sphere known before its dissolution as other names, but to your peoples as Maldek, incarnated, many within your Earth’s surface rather than upon it. The population of your planet contains many various groups harvested from other second-dimension and cycled third-dimension spheres. You are not all one race or background of beginning. The experience you share is unique to this time/space continuum.

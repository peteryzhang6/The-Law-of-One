# Discernment
The act to distinguish whether an encounter is positive or negative or neutral.

Please check [[The Mind#Healing|Healing of the Mind]] and [[Polarization]] first.

I think discernment should be done with the following in mind:
1. One must know and understand its own inner mind/body/spirit complex's bias towards an encounter that is negative - causes the closing of the heart, or positive - causes opening of the heart
2. If one has a inner positive bias towards an encounter yet is met with an encounter that closes the heart, then one can assume the encounter is negative
	- This negative encounter should be further investigated within oneself because it can be an undiscovered negative distortion within
	- After further investigation, should one determine that the encounter is negative from the outside, then one can attempt to [[Healer-Patient|heal/hurt]] the outside
	- If one determines the negative encounter is an misunderstanding or from within, then one should try [[Judge-Reflect|reflect/judge]]
3. The same can be said to one with inner negative bias towards an encounter but met with positive
4. The best way or to improve discernment is first for one to work within oneself to unite the pain and joy within oneself

11.19: We request your contemplation of the fruits of the actions of those entities whom you may observe enjoying the distortion towards power. In this way you may discern for yourself this information.

12.10: It is necessary that each being use free and complete discernment from within the all-self which is at the heart of the mind/body/spirit complex.

12.15: It is entirely possible for the untuned channel, as you call that service, to receive both positive and negative communications. If the entity at the base of its confusion is oriented towards service to others, the entity will begin to receive messages of doom. If the entity at the base of the complex of beingness is oriented towards service to self, the crusaders, who in this case, do not find it necessary to lie, will simply begin to give the philosophy they are here to give. Many of your so-called contacts among your people have been confused and self-destructive because the channels were oriented towards service to others but, in the desire for proof, were open to the lying information of the crusaders who then were able to neutralize the effectiveness of the channel.

26.36: We can only ask each group to consider the relative effect of philosophy and your so-called specific information. It is not the specificity of the information which attracts negative influences. It is the importance placed upon it.
- This is why we iterate quite often, when asked for specific information, that it pales to insignificance, just as the grass withers and dies while the love and the light of the One Infinite Creator redounds to the very infinite realms of creation forever and ever, creating and creating itself in perpetuity.
- Why then be concerned with the grass that blooms, withers and dies in its season only to grow once again due to the infinite love and light of the One Creator? This is the message we bring. Each entity is only superficially that which blooms and dies. In the deeper sense there is no end to beingness.

One can also reflect on the teachings of Jesus on
- [[Jesus Christ#True and False Prophets]] - discernment towards the other selves
- [[The Parable of the Sower]] - discernment towards the inner self

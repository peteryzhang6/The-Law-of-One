# Discernment
The act to distinguish whether an encounter is positive or negative or neutral.

I think discernment should be done with the following in mind:
1. One must know and understand its own inner mind/body/spirit complex's bias towards an encounter that is negative - causes the closing of the heart, or positive - causes opening of the heart
2. If one has a inner positive bias towards an encounter yet is met with an encounter that closes the heart, then one can assume the encounter is negative
	- This negative encounter should be further investigated within oneself because it can be an undiscovered negative distortion within.
	- After further investigation, should one determine that the encounter is negative from the outside, then one can attempt to [[Healer-Patient|heal/hurt]] the outside
	- If one determines the negative encounter is an misunderstanding or from within, then one should try [[Judge-Reflect|reflect/judge]].
3. The same can be said to one with inner negative bias towards an encounter but met with positive 
4. The best way or to improve discernment is first for one to work within oneself to unite the pain and joy within oneself

11.19: We request your contemplation of the fruits of the actions of those entities whom you may observe enjoying the distortion towards power. In this way you may discern for yourself this information.

One can also reflect on the Teaching of Jesus on
- [[Jesus#Matthew 7 15-20|The Good and Bad Fruits]] - discernment towards the other selves
- [[Jesus#Matthew 13 3-9|Parable of the Sower]] - discernment towards the inner self

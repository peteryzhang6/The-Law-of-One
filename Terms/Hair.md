# Hair
75.33: **Questioner:** You mentioned in an earlier session that the hair was an antenna. Could you expand on that statement as to how that works?

**Ra:** I am Ra. It is difficult to so do due to the metaphysical nature of this antenna-effect. Your physics are concerned with measurements in your physical complex of experience. The metaphysical nature of the contact of those in time/space is such that the hair, as it has significant length, becomes as a type of electrical battery which stays charged and tuned and is then able to aid contact even when there are small anomalies in the contact.

75.34: **Questioner:** Well, is there an optimum length of hair for this aid?

**Ra:** I am Ra. There is no outer limit on length but the, shall we say, inner limit is approximately four to four and one-half inches depending upon the strength of the contact and the nature of the instrument.

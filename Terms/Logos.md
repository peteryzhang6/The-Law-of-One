# Logos
29.4: What I’m saying is there are roughly 250 billion stars or suns something like ours in this major galaxy. Are they all part of the same sub-Logos?
- They are all part of the same Logos. Your solar system, as you would call it, is a manifestation somewhat and slightly different due to the presence of a sub-Logos.

29.5: Then our [[The Sun|sun]] is a sub-Logos of the Logos that is the major galactic Logos.

29.6: Are there any sub-sub-Logos that are found in our planetary system that are Logos that are “sub” to our sun?
- This is correct.

29.7: Would you tell me what one of those— Would you give me an example of one of those… I’ll call sub-sub-Logos?
- One example is your mind/body/spirit complex

29.8: Then every entity that exists would be some type of sub- or sub-sub-Logos. Is this correct?
- This is correct down to the limits of any observation, for the entire creation is alive.

29.9: Then the planet which we walk upon here would be some form of sub-sub-Logos. Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. A planetary entity is so named only as Logos if it is working in harmonic fashion with entities or mind/body complexes upon its surface or within its electromagnetic field.

29.10: Do the sub-Logos, such as our sun, do any of them— in our major galaxy— do they have a metaphysical polarity, shall we say, positive or negative as we’ve been using the term?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. As you use the term, this is not so. Entities through the level of planetary have the strength of intelligent infinity through the use of free will, going through the actions of beingness. The polarity is not, thusly, as you understand polarity. It is only when the planetary sphere begins harmonically interacting with mind/body complexes, and more especially mind/body/spirit complexes, that planetary spheres take on distortions due to the thought complexes of entities interacting with the planetary entity. The creation of the One Infinite Creator does not have the polarity you speak of.

29.32: I guess what we’d better get to then, now that we have traced the path of creation at least down to the crystalline structure, we’d better concentrate on the evolution of thought and its seeking path to intelligent infinity. We have created, in the major galaxy of the Logos, a very large number of planets. As these planets develop, is it possible for you to give me an example of various planetary developments in what I would call a metaphysical sense having to do with the development of consciousness and its polarities throughout the galaxy? In other words I believe that some of these planets develop quite rapidly into higher density planets and some take longer times. Can you give me some idea of that development?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. The particular Logos of your major galaxy has used a large portion of Its coalesced material to reflect the beingness of the Creator. In this way there is much of your galactic system which does not have the progression of which you speak but dwells spiritually as a portion of the Logos. Of those entities upon which consciousness dwells there is, as you surmise, a variety of time/space periods during which the higher densities of experience are attained by consciousness.

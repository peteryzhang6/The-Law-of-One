# Harvest
When a being reaches certain percentage of polarization, it is harvested or graduated to the next appropriate density.

Because 3rd density is one of choice, thus the polarization of 1D and 2D towards STO and STS is not of conscious but of the subconscious. Then in 3D, the polarization towards STO or STS becomes clear, then the initial inner working of the conscious mind is to first control the "beast", or primal distortions birthed in 1D and 2D.

Check [[STO-STS]] and [[Polarization]]

14.14: The harvest is now. There is not at this time any reason to include efforts along these distortions towards longevity, but rather to encourage distortions toward seeking the heart of self, for this which resides clearly in the violet-ray energy field will determine the harvesting of each mind/body/spirit complex.

14.15: None was harvested in the first third density cycle - 50,000 years ago.

14.16: The harvest 25,000 years ago - A harvesting began taking place in the latter portion, as you measure time/space, of the second cycle, with individuals finding the gateway to intelligent infinity. The harvest of that time, though extremely small, were those entities of extreme distortion towards service to the entities which now were to repeat the major cycle. These entities, therefore, remained in third density although they could, at any moment/present nexus, leave this density through use of intelligent infinity.
- 15.15: These shepherds, or, as some have called them, the “Elder Race,” shall choose the time/space of their leaving. They are unlikely to leave until their other-selves are harvestable also.
- 15.16: The other-selves with whom these beings are concerned are those which did not attain harvest during the second major cycle.
- 15.18: *Is the Elder Race beforementioned the same as in the book Road in the Sky by George Hunt Williamson?* - The question now resolves itself, for we have spoken previously of the manner of decision-making which caused these entities to remain here upon the closing of the second major cycle of your current master cycle. There are some distortions in the descriptions of the one known as Michel; however, these distortions have primarily to do with the fact that these entities are not a social memory complex, but rather a group of mind/body/spirit complexes dedicated to service. These entities work together, but are not completely unified; thus, they do not completely see each the other’s thoughts, feelings, and motives. However, their desire to serve is the fourth-dimensional type of desire, thus melding them into what you may call a brotherhood.
- 15.19: We called them (Elder Race) thusly to acquaint you, the questioner, with their identity as is understood by your mind complex distortion.
- 15.20: Is there any [[Wanderer]]s with these Elder Race? - These are planetary entities harvested — Wanderers only in the sense that they chose, in fourth-density love, to immediately reincarnate in third density rather than proceeding towards fourth density. This causes them to be Wanderers of a type, Wanderers who have never left the Earth plane because of their free will rather than because of their vibrational level.

14.17: There were harvestable entities who shall choose the manner of their entrance into [[4th Density|fourth dimension]].

16.11: Those able to enter fourth density through vibrational complex levels may choose the manner of their further seeking of the One Creator.

16.12: Then as we enter the fourth density there will be a split, shall we say, and part of the individuals who go into the fourth density will go to planets or places where there is service to others and the other part will go into places where there is service to self.

17.15: People of this planet, following any religion or no religion at all, or having no intellectual knowledge of the Law of One or of anything at all, can still be harvested into the fourth density if they are of that vibration.
- However, you will find few who are harvestable whose radiance does not cause others to be aware of their, what you may call, spirituality, the quality of the mind/body/spirit complex distortion. Thus, it is not particularly probable that an entity would be completely unknown to his immediate acquaintances as an unusually radiant personality, even were this individual not caught up in any of the distortions of your so-called religious systems.

17.25: It is the right/privilege/duty of those opening consciously the gate to intelligent infinity to choose the manner of their leaving of the density. Those of negative orientation who so achieve this right/duty most often choose to move forward in their learn/teaching of service to self.

17.29: Am I to understand that the harvest will occur in the year 2011, or will it be spread?
- This is an approximation. We have stated we have difficulty with your time/space. This is an appropriate probable/possible time/space nexus for harvest. Those who are not in incarnation at this time will be included in the harvest.

17.34: Well, then if an entity is harvested into fourth density with a grade, let’s say, of fifty-one percent for others, forty-nine percent for self, what level of the fourth density would he go into? I’m assuming there are different levels of the fourth density.
- This is correct. Each enters the sub-density which vibrates in accordance with the entity’s understanding.

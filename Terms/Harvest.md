# Harvest
When a being reaches certain percentage of polarization, it is harvested or graduated to the next appropriate density.

A STS will need to achieve a 95% or more polarization towards the self.

A STO will need to achieve a 50% or more polarization toward others.

Because 3rd density is one of choice, thus the polarization of 1D and 2D towards STO and STS is not of conscious but of the subconscious. Then in 3D, the polarization towards STO or STS becomes clear, then the initial inner working of the conscious mind is to first control the "beast", or primal distortions birthed in 1D and 2D.

Check [[STO-STS]] and [[Polarization]]

14.14: The harvest is now. There is not at this time any reason to include efforts along these distortions towards longevity, but rather to encourage distortions toward seeking the heart of self, for this which resides clearly in the violet-ray energy field will determine the harvesting of each mind/body/spirit complex.

14.15: None was harvested in the first third density cycle - 50,000 years ago.

14.16: The harvest 25,000 years ago - A harvesting began taking place in the latter portion, as you measure time/space, of the second cycle, with individuals finding the gateway to intelligent infinity. The harvest of that time, though extremely small, were those entities of extreme distortion towards service to the entities which now were to repeat the major cycle. These entities, therefore, remained in third density although they could, at any moment/present nexus, leave this density through use of intelligent infinity.

14.17: There were harvestable entities who shall choose the manner of their entrance into [[4th Density|fourth dimension]].

# Harvest
When a being reaches certain percentage of polarization, it is harvested or graduated to the next appropriate density.

A STS will need to achieve a 95% or more polarization towards the self.

A STO will need to achieve a 50% or more polarization toward others.

Because 3rd density is one of choice, thus the polarization of 1D and 2D towards STO and STS is not of conscious but of the subconscious. Then in 3D, the polarization towards STO or STS becomes clear, then the initial inner working of the conscious mind is to first control the "beast", or primal distortions birthed in 1D and 2D.

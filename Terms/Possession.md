# Possession
A concept used to describe the blockage of heart chakra or [[Green Ray]]

To use the Yin/Yang format or Law of Doubling of 1, 2, 4, we can break down possession in terms of or types of possession mentioned by Ra, into:

| Table 1      | Inward Force            | Outward Force          |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Self Inward  | Fear of being possessed | Desire to be possessed |
| Self Outward | Fear of possessing      | Desire to possess      |

If *possession* is a negative charged word, then we can use *acceptance* as the positive charged word. Thus we can update the table to:

| Table 2      | Inward Force           | Outward Force         |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Self Inward  | Fear of being accepted | Desire to be accepted |
| Self Outward | Fear of accepting      | Desire to accept      |

Thus for a positive polarized entity, table 1 shows its blockage. For a negative polarized entity, table 2 shows its blockage. 

So for positive entity, one needs to learn to accept all that there is as the Love and Light of the One Infinite Creator. For negative entity, one needs to possess all that there is.

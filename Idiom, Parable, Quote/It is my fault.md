From 2021 to 2024, when I talked to my [[Wan Hongjie|mom]] about the pain and frustration she caused me in the past, and overwhelmed by her guilt and mistakes, she would say "It is my fault." (是我的错)

I believe in a few days before, I told her you can say this when you made a mistake, but you should also add "I will do better", a statement that expresses the conscious act of improving and better oneself. 

I told her this because of the idea of Law of One that all is conscious, thus when she states "it is my fault", it is easy for her mind to be stuck on her mistake and thus cementing this fact and cause her to repeat the mistake again in the future. 

I also have to reduce telling her past of mistakes as this is also enhancing her mistakes in her mind. Thus I will need to do more forgiveness and reconciliation. #forgive-reconcile

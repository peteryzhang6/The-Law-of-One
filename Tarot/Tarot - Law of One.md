# Tarot in Law of One

>[!NOTE]
>Images in black and white

A card system developed by Ra which contained 22 cards. 7 for mind, 7 for body, 7 for spirit, and 1 for The Choice. Thought later the cards' names were given and more cards added.

For mind, body, and spirit, the 7 categories
1. [[The Matrix]]
2. [[The Potentiator]]
3. [[The Catalyst]]
4. [[The Experience]]
5. [[The Significator]]
6. [[The Transformation]]
7. [[The Great Way]]

The first 3 categories can be viewed as a trinity (1-3): The matrix (1st density, red ray, beingness) acts as the foundation for all things that are yet to come. Then the potentiator (2nd density, orange ray, movement and growth) comes into the matrix to give it energy and movement. Then the catalyst (3rd density, yellow ray, self-conscious) comes to be, the Light, born out of intelligent infinity/energy interacting with Love. 

Then a choice is successfully made by one of either positive ([[Service to Other]]) or negative ([[Service to Self]]), one will move onto the next trinity:

One moves into the next trinity (4-6): One will first have The Experience (4th density, green ray, Love and Understanding) as a result of the choice. Then one will contemplate, thus the Significator (5th density, blue ray, Light and Wisdom) or significance of the choice and experience. Lastly one will experience a transformation (6th density, indigo ray, Oneness) of self.

The first trinity can be viewed as yin and the second as yang. When the two trinity is truly united, the great way (7th density, violet ray, foreverness) opens. One have the option of progressing into the next octave or incarnate back into the first trinity to further enhance one's understanding.

Ra uses "triad" instead of "trinity". (54.17)

The above description is talked about in 54.17.

[Ra's opinion on each card](https://www.lawofone.info/c/Tarot)

78.30: **Questioner:** Are the seven archetypes for mind a function of or related to the seven densities that are to be experienced in the octave?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The relationship is tangential in that no congruency may be seen. However, the progress through the archetypes has some of the characteristics of the progress through the densities. These relationships may be viewed without being, shall we say, pasted one upon the other.

*thoughts:* The archetypes for mind refers to the Major Arcane of 1-7

78.31: **Questioner:** How about the seven bodily energy centers? Are they related to archetypes in some way?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The same may be said of these. It is informative to view the relationships but stifling to insist upon the limitations of congruency. Recall at all times, if you would use this term, that the archetypes are a portion of the resources of the mind complex.

78.32: **Questioner:** Then is there any relationship between the archetypes and the planets of our solar system?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is not a simple query. Properly, the archetypes have some relationship to the planets. However, this relationship is not one which can be expressed in your language. This, however, has not halted those among your people who have become adepts from attempting to name and describe these relationships. To most purely understand, if we may use this misnomer, the archetypes it is well to view the concepts which make up each archetype and reserve the study of planets and other correspondences for meditation.

79.20: **Questioner:** I would like to try and understand the archetypes of the mind of this Logos prior to the extension of the first distortion. In order to better understand that which we experience now I believe that this is a logical approach.  
  
We have, as you have stated, the matrix, potentiator, and the significator. I understand the matrix as being that which is the conscious, what we call the conscious mind, but since it is also that from which the mind is made, I am at a loss to fully understand these three terms, especially with respect to the time before there was a division between conscious and unconscious. I think it is important to get a good understanding of these three things. Could you expand even more upon the Matrix of the Mind, the Potentiator, and the Significator, how they differ, and what their relationships are, please?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The Matrix of Mind is that from which all comes. It is unmoving yet is the activator in potentiation of all mind activity. The Potentiator of the Mind is that great resource which may be seen as the sea into which the consciousness dips ever deeper and more thoroughly in order to create, ideate, and become more self-conscious.  
  
The Significator of each mind, body, and spirit may be seen as a simple and unified concept.  
  
The Matrix of the Body may be seen to be a reflection in opposites of the mind; that is, unrestricted motion. The Potentiator of the Body then is that which, being informed, regulates activity.  
  
The Matrix of the Spirit is difficult to characterize since the nature of spirit is less motile. The energies and movements of the spirit are, by far, the most profound, yet, having more close association with time/space, do not have the characteristics of dynamic motion. Thusly one may see the Matrix as the deepest darkness and the Potentiator of Spirit as the most sudden awakening, illuminating, and generative influence.  
  
This is the description of Archetypes One through Nine before the onset of influence of the co-Creator or sub-Logos realization of free will.

79.21: **Questioner:** The first change made then for this extension of free will was to make the information or make the communication between the Matrix and Potentiator of the Mind relatively unavailable one to the other during the incarnation. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. We would perhaps rather term the condition as relatively more mystery-filled than relatively unavailable.

79.22: **Questioner:** Well, the idea then was to create some type of veil between Matrix and Potentiator. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.

79.23: **Questioner:** This veil then occurs between what we now call the conscious and the unconscious mind. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.

79.24: **Questioner:** It was probably the design of the Logos by doing this to allow the conscious mind greater freedom under the first distortion by partitioning, you might say, the individualized portions of this from the Potentiator or unconscious which had a greater communication with the total mind, therefore allowing for, you might say, the birth of uneducated, to use a poor term, portions of consciousness. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is roughly correct.

79,27: **Questioner:** I was just wondering since this seems to be the crux of the experiment— this seems to be the large breaking point between no extension of the first distortion and the extension of the first distortion— what the result of this original experiment was with respect to that which was created from it. What was the result of that?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is previously covered material. The result of these experiments has been a more vivid, varied, and intense experience of Creator by Creator.

79.28: **Questioner:** Well, I was aware of that. I probably didn’t state the question correctly. It’s a very difficult question to state. I don’t know if it’s worth attempting to continue with but what I meant was when this very first experiment with the veiling process occurred, did it result in service-to-self polarization with the first experiment?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The early, if we may use this term, Logoi produced service-to-self and service-to-others mind/body/spirit complexes immediately. The harvestability of these entities was not so immediate and thus refinements of the archetypes began apace.

79.29: **Questioner:** Now we are getting to what I was trying to determine. Then at this point were there still only nine archetypes and the veil had just been drawn between the Matrix and Potentiator?

**Ra:** I am Ra. There were nine archetypes and many shadows.

79.30: **Questioner:** By shadows do you mean what I might refer to as the birthing of small archetypical biases?

**Ra:** I am Ra. Rather we would describe these shadows as the inchoate thoughts of helpful structures not yet fully conceived.

79.31: **Questioner:** Then at this point, would the Choice exist at this point, the creation of the first service-to-self polarity? Is there a choice at that point or is it a non-choice?

**Ra:** I am Ra. Implicit in the veiling or separation of two archetypes is the concept of choice. The refinements to this concept took many experiences.

79.32: **Questioner:** I’m sorry that I have much difficulty in asking these questions, but we’re on material that I find somewhat difficult.  
  
I find it interesting that the very first experiment of veiling Matrix from the Potentiator and vice-versa created service-to-self polarity. This seems to be a very important philosophical point in the development of the creation and possibly the beginning of a system of what we would call magic not envisioned previously.  
  
Let me ask this question. Prior to the extension of first distortion was the magical potential of the higher densities as great as it is now when the greatest potential was achieved in consciousness for each density? This is difficult to ask. What I am saying is at the end of fourth density, prior to the extension of free will, was the magical potential, what we call magic, as great, or the ability, or the effect as great as it is now at the end of fourth density?

**Ra:** I am Ra. As you understand, if we may use this misnomer, magic, the magical potential in third and fourth density was then far greater than after the change. However, there was far, far less desire or will to use this potential.

79.33: **Questioner:** Now, let me be sure I understand you: prior to the change and the extension of free will, let’s take specifically the end of fourth density, magical potential for the condition when there was only service-to-others polarization, magical ability or potential was much greater at the end of fourth density than at the end of fourth density immediately after the split of polarization and the extension of free will. Is that correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. Magical ability is the ability to consciously use the so-called unconscious. Therefore, there was maximal ability prior to the innovation of sub-Logoi’s free will.

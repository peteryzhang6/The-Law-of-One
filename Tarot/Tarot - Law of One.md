A card system developed by Ra which contained 22 cards. 7 for mind, 7 for body, 7 for spirit, and 1 for The Choice. Thought later the cards' names were given and more cards added.

For mind, body, and spirit, the 7 categories
1. [[The Matrix]]
2. [[The Potentiator]]
3. [[The Catalyst]]
4. [[The Experience]]
5. [[The Significator]]
6. [[The Transformation]]
7. [[The Great Way]]

The first 3 categories can be viewed as a trinity (1-3): The matrix (1st density, red ray, beingness) acts as the foundation for all things that are yet to come. Then the potentiator (2nd density, orange ray, movement and growth) comes into the matrix to give it energy and movement. Then the catalyst (3rd density, yellow ray, self-conscious) comes to be, the Light, born out of intelligent infinity/energy interacting with Love. 

Then a choice is successfully made by one of either positive ([[Service to Other]]) or negative ([[Service to Self]]), one will move onto the next trinity:

One moves into the next trinity (4-6): One will first have The Experience (4th density, green ray, Love and Understanding) as a result of the choice. Then one will contemplate, thus the Significator (5th density, blue ray, Light and Wisdom) or significance of the choice and experience. Lastly one will experience a transformation (6th density, indigo ray, Oneness) of self.

The first trinity can be viewed as yin and the second as yang. When the two trinity is truly united, the great way (7th density, violet ray, foreverness) opens. One have the option of progressing into the next octave or incarnate back into the first trinity to further enhance one's understanding.

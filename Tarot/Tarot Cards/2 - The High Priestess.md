The letters B and J on the High Priestess tarot card represent the pillars of Boaz and Jachin, which are located on either side of the card: 
- **Boaz**: The black pillar with the letter B, which means "in one's strength" 
- **Jachin**: The white pillar with the letter J, which means "one will establish" 
- **Meaning**: The pillars represent opposites, such as dark and light, male and female, or yin and yang. The High Priestess card depicts a high priest sitting between the pillars in silent contemplation, which can symbolize secret openings and the eventual unveiling of the truth.

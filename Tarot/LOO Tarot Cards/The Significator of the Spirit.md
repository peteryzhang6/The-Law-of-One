80.16: **Questioner:** I guess that the nineteenth archetype of the spirit would be the Significator of the Spirit. Is that correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.

80.17: **Questioner:** How would you describe the Significator of the Spirit?

**Ra:** I am Ra. In answer to the previous query we set about doing just this. The Significator of the Spirit is that living entity which either radiates or absorbs the love and the light of the One Infinite Creator, radiates it to others or absorbs it for the self.

80.18: **Questioner:** Then would this process of radiation or absorption, since we have what I would call a flux or flux rate, be the measure of the power of the adept?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This may be seen to be a reasonably adequate statement.

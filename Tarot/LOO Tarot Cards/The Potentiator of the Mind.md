78.34: **Questioner:** Would the archetype then that has been called the High Priestess, which represents the intuition, be properly the second of the archetypes?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct. You see here the recapitulation of the beginning knowledge of this Logos; that is, matrix and potentiator. The unconscious is indeed what may be poetically described as High Priestess, for it is the Potentiator of the Mind and as potentiator for the mind is that principle which potentiates all experience.

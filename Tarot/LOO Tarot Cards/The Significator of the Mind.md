79.37: **Questioner:** What would be the Hierophant?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The Hierophant is the Significator of the Mind complex, its very nature. We may note that the characteristics of which you speak do have bearing upon the Significator of the Mind complex but are not the heart. The heart of the mind complex is that dynamic entity which absorbs, seeks, and attempts to learn.

79.38: **Questioner:** Then is the Hierophant the link, you might say, between the mind and the body?

**Ra:** I am Ra. There is a strong relationship between the significators of the mind, the body, and the spirit. Your statement is too broad.

79.42: **Questioner:** Then I will just ask for the one of the archetypes which I am least understanding at this point if I can use that word at all. I am still very much in the dark, so to speak, with respect to the Hierophant and precisely what it is. Could you give me some other indication of what that is, please?

**Ra:** I am Ra. You have been most interested in the Significator which must needs become complex. The Hierophant is the original archetype of mind which has been made complex through the subtile movements of the conscious and unconscious. The complexities of mind were evolved rather than the simple melding of experience from Potentiator to Matrix.  
  
The mind itself became an actor possessed of free will and, more especially, will. As the Significator of the mind, the Hierophant has the will to know, but what shall it do with its knowledge, and for what reasons does it seek? The potential[s] of a complex significator are manifold.  
  
Are there any brief queries at this working?

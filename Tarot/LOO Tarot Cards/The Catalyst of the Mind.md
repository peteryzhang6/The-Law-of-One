78.36: **Questioner:** I was asking if the third archetype was the Empress and was it correct to say that this archetype had to do with disciplined meditation?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The third archetype may be broadly grasped as the Catalyst of the Mind. Thus it takes in far more than disciplined meditation. However, it is certainly through this faculty that catalyst is most efficiently used. The Archetype, Three, is perhaps confusedly called Empress although the intention of this nomer is the understanding that it represents the unconscious or female portion of the mind complex being first, shall we say, used or ennobled by the male or conscious portion of the mind. Thus the noble name.

*Thoughts*: if here male is represented as consciousness and female as subconsciousness, then it is explainable that in [[Bible]] states that the female to listen to the male as a metaphor, like Ra stated here.

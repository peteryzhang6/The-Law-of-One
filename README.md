[The Law of One by Ra - A Humble Messenger of The Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/) 

This repository is of an seeking/understanding of The Law of One by the entity Peter Yunpeng Zhang.

The excerpts taken from The Law of One will be labelled in tags or titles in the format of session/question/paragraph. Example: (# 1 / 10 / 1)

I will try that no same excerpt appears twice within this documentation but instead linking them together to show an ever-deepening connection of consciousness.

The repo currently contains files I created previously in other locations, thus may lack the inter-connection. And I currently intent this repo to be used with a focus solely on the development of individual mind/body/spirit complex, thus certain materials will be removed and excluded, and certain materials will be simply jotted down and not edited.

# TODOs

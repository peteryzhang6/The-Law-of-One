# The Law of One
*Please use text editor Obsidian or similar software for best reading experiences*

[The Law of One by Ra - A Humble Messenger of The Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/) 

> [!NOTE]
> One may find difficulty in reading the material of Law of One and other spiritual materials, as did I too experienced difficulty in understanding the Law of One when I first started reading it in Fall of 2020 and I only completed Book 1 of Law of One. I experience great pain and difficulty in merging the Law of One with other spiritual materials with my personal experience through 2020 to 2022. In 2023-2024, I again read through Book 1 to Book 4 to session 90+, but this time was able to learn and understand materials previously not understood. Now in this repo, it is my third time reading and am attempting to create more comprehensive understanding which I can track and expand upon.

This repository is of an seeking/understanding of The Law of One by the entity Peter Yunpeng Zhang and an attempt to share this understanding to those who are also on the path and wants a different point of view.

The excerpts taken from The Law of One will be labelled in tags or titles in the format of session/question. Example: (# 1-10 ) I do not use the format like those of Law of One website is because the tag in Obsidian doesn't support dot.

The format will be one that like those often used in bible studies, by taking excerpts that relate to each other and can build strong bonds. Like Ra and those in L/L Research Channelings often said: "Take what you resonate and leave those that doesn't." Spiritual materials outside of Law of One will also be added to further support and unite understandings.
- **1.10:** Thus, to attempt to discern and weave your way through as many group mind/body/spirit distortions as possible among your peoples in the course of your teaching is a very good effort to make.

The repo currently contains files I created previously in other locations, thus may lack the inter-connection and formats. And I currently intent this repo to be used with a focus solely on the development of individual mind/body/spirit complex, thus materials that doesn't focus on the mind/body/spirit complex will be excluded or simply jotted down and not edited. If I have time, then those excluded materials will be added later on. Or one can simply go study it in Law of One website for one's own interest/distortion.
- 12.25: We interpret the Law of One, but not to the extent of advice. #TODO

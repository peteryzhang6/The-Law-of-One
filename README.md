[The Law of One by Ra - A Humble Messenger of The Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/) 

> [!NOTE]
> One may find difficulty in reading the material of Law of One and other spiritual materials, as did I too experienced difficulty in understanding the Law of One when I first started reading it in Fall of 2020 and I only completed Book 1 of Law of One. I experience great pain and difficulty during 2020 to 2022 in merging the Law of One with other spiritual materials with my personal experience. 
> 
> In 2023-2024, I again read through Book 1 to Book 4 to session 90+, but this time was able to learn and understand materials previously not understood. 
> 
> Now in this repo, it is my third time reading and am attempting to create more comprehensive understanding which I can track and expand upon.

This repository is of an seeking/understanding of The Law of One by the entity Peter Yunpeng Zhang and an attempt to share this understanding to those who are also on the path and wants a different point of view.

The excerpts taken from The Law of One will be labelled like that in L/L Research Law of One website, example: (1.10).

The format will be one that like those often used in bible studies, by taking excerpts that relate to each other, to build a comprehensive understanding and relation on the many topics. Like Ra, those in L/L Research Channelings, and many other spiritual teachers often said: "Take what you resonate and leave those that doesn't." Spiritual materials outside of Law of One will also be added to further support and unite understandings.
- [[Session 1#1.10]]: Thus, to attempt to discern and weave your way through as many group mind/body/spirit distortions as possible among your peoples in the course of your teaching is a very good effort to make.
- 12.25: We interpret the Law of One, but not to the extent of advice. #TODO

The repo currently contains files I created previously in other locations, thus may lack the inter-connection and formats. And I currently intent this repo to be used with a focus solely on the development of individual mind/body/spirit complex, thus materials that doesn't focus on the mind/body/spirit complex will be excluded or simply jotted down, not edited, and be in the supplementary repository. If one have personal distortions towards these supplementary materials, one can simply go study it in Law of One website or check supplementary repo.
# Table of Contents
- [[Prayer]] and [[Chant]]
# TODOs
- [x] (currently working on) go through Law of One session by session to extract excerpts and categorize them into appropriate files along with minor comments
- [ ] detailed comments and understanding will be added and further categorization and breakdown of large files into smaller digestible files; each session will also be added for easier linking and comprehension

		- 35.1: It is to be noted that in discussing those who are well-known among your peoples there is the possibility that information may be seen to be specific to one entity whereas in actuality the great design of experience is much the same for each entity. It is with this in mind that we would discuss the experiential forces which offered catalyst to an individual.

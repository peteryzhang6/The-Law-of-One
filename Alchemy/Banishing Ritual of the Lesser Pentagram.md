# Banishing Ritual of the Lesser Pentagram
41.1-3: Used to prepare a place for a dedicated use

74.14: **Questioner:** In selecting a protective ritual we finally agreed upon the Banishing Ritual of the Lesser Pentagram. I assume that these sound vibratory complexes are the type you speak for the alerting of those on the inner planes. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.

76.4: Its effect is purification, cleansing, and protection of the place of working.

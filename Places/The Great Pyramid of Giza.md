# The Great Pyramid of Giza
14.6: There are six balancing pyramids and five two, fifty-two (52) others built for additional healing and initiatory work among your mind/body/spirit social complexes.
- *balancing pyramids* - 14.7: Imagine, if you will, the many force fields of the Earth in their geometrically precise web. Energies stream into the Earth planes, as you would call them, from magnetically determined points. Due to growing thought-form distortions in understanding of the Law of One, the planet itself was seen to have the potential for imbalance. The balancing pyramidal structures were charged with crystals which drew the appropriate balance from the energy forces streaming into the various geometrical centers of electromagnetic energy which surround and shape the planetary sphere.
- 14.10: The balancing pyramidal structures could be and were used for individual initiation. However, the use of these pyramids was also designed for the balancing of the planetary energy web. The other pyramids are not placed properly for Earth healing but for healing of mind/body/spirit complexes. It came to our attention that your density was distorted towards, what is called by our distortion/understanding of third density, a premature aging process. We were attempting to aid in giving the mind/body/spirit complexes of third density on your planetary sphere, more of a time/space continuum in one incarnation pattern in order to have a fuller opportunity to learn/teach the Laws or Ways of the primal distortion of the Law of One which is Love.

Session 23

27.2: Consider, if you will, the intelligent infinity present in the absorption of livingness and beingness as it becomes codified into intelligent energy, due to the thought impressions of those assisting the living stone into a new shape of beingness. The release and use of intelligent infinity for a brief period begins to absorb all the consecutive or interlocking dimensions, thus offering brief glimpses of those projecting to the material their thought. These beings thus beginning to materialize but not remaining visible. These beings were the thought-form or third-density-visible manifestation of our social memory complex as we offered contact from our intelligent infinity to the intelligent infinity of the stone.
# Idea on reviving The Great Pyramid of Giza
**To note: this is only an assumption or theory, which means mistakes is presented. Before taking this plan out of paper into reality, it is best to further realize the theory into its full completeness.**

4.8: I am Ra. There are people, as you call them, who are able to take this calling at this nexus. However, we wish to point out once again that the time of the pyramids, as you would call it, is past. It is indeed a timeless structure. However, the streamings from the universe were, at the time we attempted to aid this planet, those which required a certain understanding of purity. This understanding has, as the streamings revolve and all things evolve, changed to a more enlightened view of purity. Thus, there are those among your people at this time whose purity is already one with intelligent infinity. Without the use of structures, healer/patient can gain healing.
- I understand this as once people are in tune in 4D and understand the healing procedures, the function of the pyramid is unnecessary. But since the Pyramid of Giza is such a marvel of human civilization and so many people go visit it, and I somewhat feel as a duty/responsibility of us, we should revitalize the pyramid to its former glory. To use an metaphor, we go see an emperor or king, we don't want to see it in its worse shape and state, and the pyramid is in such a state of death, of destruction. Thus we dress the emperor and king, to honor the power and wisdom it holds, thus we reconstruct the pyramid, to "dress the naked emperor" into a form that is fitting for its statue.

This is an idea of tuning The Great Pyramid back to its original tune 
- or the current vibration
- or the original The Great Pyramid is constructed based on the tune of 3D Earth to elevate entities to 4D. Now Earth is already 4D, we need to retune the vibration of the pyramid to 4D 
- we should start on tuning the body of the pyramid first
- then tune the mind and spirit of the pyramid
## Tuning of the body of the pyramid
I think it is a good idea to start the de-desertification of the areas around the Great Pyramid as I believe the green of 2nd density can further help the tuning of the pyramid.

I think we can also build sound walls for each the 7 circles to further let the sound converge into the pyramid. Once the pyramid is tuned, the walls can be removed.

And of course, the chimney or the capstone of the pyramid needs to be rebuild. The material for the capstone should not be gold, as iirc, Ra said "Gold is the physical mineral manifestation of the 3D light", thus we need to use a material of metal or rock that is green in color, which matches the 4D Earth.

The surface of the pyramid should also be fixed.

Once the physical body of the pyramid is fixed, then we can start tuning the mind and spirit of the pyramid. The mind and spirit is tuned by the full-hearted chant of "Yi" and "I" while have all consciousness focused on the pyramid, or the capstone(?).
## Tuning of the mind and spirit of pyramid
We will need a large amount of group of people to surround the Great Pyramid in circles. The number of people is that one of ratio of pyramid and of Earth.

There should be 7 circles, each one represent a density from 1st to 7th.

In each circle, we need two types of people:
- one type in charge of pronouncing the tone of "one", or "一" in Chinese, which is "Yi"
- one type in charge of pronouncing the tone of "I" in English, which sounds like "爱" or "love" in Chinese
- these two types of people should alternate like that of 1, 0, 1, 0... for each circle
	1. or for 1st circle (1st density) use "Yi", 2nd circle use "I", 3rd "Yi", and... to 7th circle ending with "Yi"
	2. or vice verse the above
	3. or have a ratio of (1 Yi : 2 I), ex: if circle one have 99 people, then 1 person chant "Yi" then followed by 2 people chant "I"
	4. (2 Yi : 1 I)
	5. (3 Yi : 1 I) : (1 Yi : 3 I)
	6. so on and on

I feel that the vibration of "Yi" has more of an outward force while vibration of "I" has more of an inward force.

Devices that measure frequency and vibration should be placed:
- at the King's and Queen's chamber
- Through out the major energy center of the pyramid. Either on the inside or outside

Measured vibration and/or frequency:
- I assume the heart chakra frequency is that of 639 Hz
- First measure the vibration/frequency within and without the pyramid
- Then the people chanting "Yi" and "I" should chant at the frequency of 639 Hz
- Then together through the 639 Hz of chants, hopefully with create such vibration to let the pyramid feel it

**Interesting thought**: remember Ra said something that The Great Pyramid of Giza is one such creation that is timeless. I assume Ra didn't say space less which is because it is taking up spaces, but timeless is because it is eternally alive, which means it is part of the Earth, like the moles on our body. Thus if we bring Love and Light through the chants, it will allow this pyramid to be activated, which will in turn activate the hibernating pyramids through out Earth. Like Ra said, "If one is illuminated, isn't all illuminated?" So if we do successful retune the Great Pyramid of Giza to 4D, then all the other pyramids should slowly wake up from 3D to 4D, thus allowing more 4D energy to flow through the Earth.

For a period of time, the 7 circles of people should move in clockwise motion while chanting "Yi" and "I" alternating. For example, "Yi" for 2 seconds, then switch to "I" for 2 seconds, then back to "Yi", then to "I", and such.

Different methods should also be tested to see which is the best result:
1. chanting while moving in clockwise for all 7 circles
2. chanting while moving in counter-clockwise for all 7 circles
3. chanting while moving in clockwise for 1, 3, 5, and 7 circles and moving in counter-clockwise for 2, 4, 6 circles
4. having specific circles moving in clockwise and in counter, like: (+ for clockwise, - for counter)
	1. (1234+, 567-)
	2. (123-, 4+, 567-)
5. These movements should also be combined with the ratio of people chanting "Yi" and "I"
6. or maybe this movement is not necessary, and just have people in stationary and facing the pyramid
	- maybe this should be tried first as moving in coordination is more difficult, but I theorize that moving has a better help on the flow of energy, which is stagnant and rotted. Once the energy starts to move, then one can settle and sit to further stabilize the energy.

The people who are in the circle chanting should be of those whose heart chakra is activated or already tuned into 4D for best result.

We can also shine different colors of light during night to further speed up the tuning or help stablalize the tuning.

To further reduce the work done during chanting and moving, I believe a detailed math and science calculation of vibration and frequency of the sound vibration of "Yi" and "I" can be done.
- how loud should the chant be, and each should chant at this level of loudness or level of vibration
- few points I can think of, but I believe those who are experts and adepts on sound vibration and its effects can come up with way more calculation and fixes
## After tuning
If the tuning is successful, I would assume these things to happen:
- the dormant pyramids across world should start to wake up
- the flow of 4D energy will be accelerated 
- the magnetic field of Earth will be affected
- possible landscape change

# Galaxy
16.34: We use that (this) term in this sense as you would use star systems.
- 16.35: The galaxy term must be split. We call galaxy that vibrational complex that is local. Thus, your sun is what we would call the center of a galaxy. We see you have another meaning for this term.

10.16 **Questioner:** Only one, other than what we can do to make the instrument more comfortable. I have only one other question. I would like to have brief information of the word you use, “galaxy.”
- **Ra:** I am Ra. We use the term known to your people by the sound vibration complex “galaxy.” We accept that some galaxies contain one system of planetary and solar groups, others containing several. However, the importance of the locus in infinite time/space dimensionality is so little that we accept the distortion implicit in such an ambiguous term.

10.17 **Questioner:** Then would nine planets and our sun we have here in our system, would you refer to that as a solar galaxy?
- **Ra:** We would not.

10.18 **Questioner:** How many stars, approximately, would be in a galaxy?
- **Ra:** It depends upon the galactic system. Your own, as you know, contains many, many, millions of planet entities and star bodies.

16.25: How man inhabited planets are there in our galaxy? - We are assuming that you intend all dimensions of consciousness or densities of awareness in this question. Approximately one-fifth of all planetary entities contain awareness of one or more densities. Some planetary spheres are hospitable only for certain densities. Your planetary sphere, for instance, is at this time hospitable to levels or densities one, two, three, and four.

16.26: Roughly how many total planets in this galaxy of stars that we’re in have aware life regardless of density?
- Ra: I am Ra. Approximately six seven, oh oh oh, oh oh oh (67,000,000).
- 16.27: A percentage seventeen for first density, a percentage twenty for second density, a percentage twenty-seven for third density, a percentage sixteen for fourth density, a percentage six for fifth density. The other information must be withheld. The free will of your future is not making this available. We shall speak on one item. There is a fairly large percentage, approximately thirty-five percent of the intelligent planets, which do not fit in the percentiles. These mysteries are of sixth and seventh density and are not available for our speaking.
- 16.28: this first five densities, have all of them progressed from third density by knowledge and application of the Law of One.
- 16.30: this is not a query to which we may speak given the Law of Confusion. We may say only that the negatively or self-service oriented planetary spheres are much fewer. To give you exact numbers would not be appropriate.

28.15: Now, as the major galaxy is created, and I am assuming all of its densities— I am assuming all— there are eight densities created when this major galaxy is created

30.16: Well then, could you generally say that as you get closer to the center of this major galactic system that there is a greater spiritual density, I’ll use the term, or that this general spiritual quality is advanced at that area?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This will be the last full question of this session as this instrument is somewhat uncomfortable. We do not wish to deplete the instrument.
- The spiritual density or mass of those more towards the center of your galaxy is known. However, this is due simply to the varying timelessness states during which the planetary spheres may coalesce, this process of space/time beginnings occurring earlier, shall we say, as you approach the center of the galactic spiral.

40.2: Our astronomers have noticed that the light from spiral galaxies is approximately seven times less than it should be, from their calculations of what their mass should be. I was just wondering if that was due to the increase of spiritual mass in the galaxies in what we call white dwarf stars?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This is basically correct and is a portion of the way or process of creation’s cycle.

71.9: Are the processes that we are talking about processes that occur on many planets in our Milky Way Galaxy, or do they occur on all planets, or what percentage?

**Ra:** I am Ra. These processes occur upon all planets which have given birth to sub-Logoi such as yourselves. The percentage of inhabited planets is approximately 10%.

71.10: What percentage of stars, roughly, have planetary systems?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is unimportant information, but harmless. Approximately 32% of stars have planets as you know them while another 6% have some sort of clustering material which upon some densities might be inhabitable.

71.11: **Questioner:** Well, this would tell me that roughly 3% of all stars have inhabited planets, which would just give a, shall I say, mind-boggling idea of the number of entities which… I assume then this process of evolution is in use throughout the known universe. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This octave of infinite knowledge of the One Creator is as it is throughout the One Infinite Creation, with variations programmed by sub-Logoi of what you call major galaxies and minor galaxies. These variations are not significant but may be compared to various regions of geographical location sporting various ways of pronouncing the same sound vibration complex or concept.

71.12: **Questioner:** Then it seems to me from this that the sub-Logos such as our sun uses free will to modify only slightly a much more general idea of created evolution so that the general plan of created evolution, which seems then to be uniform throughout the One Infinite Creation, is for this process of the sub-Logoi to grow through the densities and, under the first distortion, find their way back to the original thought. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct.

71.13: **Questioner:** Then each entity is on a path that leads to the [[One Original Thought|one destination]]. This is like many, many roads which travel through many, many places but eventually merge into one large center. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is correct but somewhat wanting in depth of description. More applicable would be the thought that each entity contains within it all of the densities and sub-densities of the octave so that in each entity, no matter whither its choices lead it, its great internal blueprint is one with all others. Thusly its experiences will fall into the patterns of the journey back to the original Logos. This is done through free will but the materials from which choices can be made are one blueprint.

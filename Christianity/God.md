Colossians 1:13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves.

1 Peter 2:9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, Godâ€™s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

Men are born out of darkness, not to say that men are inherently evil, but to say that men is born out of ignorance. The fire or light Lucifer brought is one to open one's eye to one's own mind. to illuminate who men really are, to make men realize their true nature of good and raise them to godhood. in this never ending universe, if one were not proud of its work or puts no heart in one's work, one might as well not do it at all. 

the act of men being born in darkness and being illuminated by light can be described, in Law of One's words that 1st density is the density of being, then through the movements of 2nd density creates is conscious mind of 3rd density, the light within.

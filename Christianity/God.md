# GOD

In a more broad or general sense, God can be seen as a being that is capable of creating, of giving life and meaning to ...

Colossians 1:13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves.

in bible or somewhere, it says that men are born out of darkness, not to say that men are inherently evil, but to say that men is born out of ignorance. The fire or light Lucifer brought is one to open one's eye to one's own mind. to illuminate who men really are, to make men realize their true nature of good and raise them to godhood. in this never ending universe, if one were not proud of its work or puts no heart in one's work, one might as well not do it at all. 

the act of men being born in darkness and being illuminated by light can be described, in Law of One's words that 1st density is the density of being, then through the movements of 2nd density creates is conscious mind of 3rd density, the light within.

I want to be with God so I can see all the things that went around me, all the talks and laughs behind my back on my pain and suffering, and have this worry answered, and show everyone single one them of their ignorance and madness. do I want to laugh at your stupidity and misery? not really. do I want to cry at my way of being treated? not really. maybe if we sew our mouth up, maybe we could develop telepathy faster than we can imagine. maybe we sew our eyes up, maybe we can develop clairvoyant faster than we can imagine. maybe we sew our ears up, maybe we can hear each others feelings sooner. #anger #madness

# Ten Commandments
Exodus 20
1. And God spoke all these words:

2. “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.

3. “You shall have no other gods before (beside) me.

4. “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. 
5. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, 
6. but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.

7. “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.

8. “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
9. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 
10. but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. 
11. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

12. “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

13. “You shall not murder.

14. “You shall not commit adultery.

15. “You shall not steal.

16. “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.

17. “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”

16.15: The origin of these commandments follows the law of negative entities impressing information upon positively oriented mind/body/spirit complexes. The information attempted to copy or ape positivity while retaining negative characteristics.
- 16.16: Done by Orion group

16.18: The recipient was one of extreme positivity, thus accounting for some of the pseudo-positive characteristics of the information received. As with contacts which are not successful, this entity, vibratory complex, Moishe, did not remain a credible influence among those who had first heard the philosophy of One and this entity was removed from this third-density vibratory level in a lessened or saddened state, having lost what you may call the honor and faith with which he had begun the conceptualization of the Law of One and the freeing of those who were of his tribes, as they were called at that time/space.
- 16.19: This was an intensive, shall we say, battleground between positively oriented forces of Confederation origin and negatively oriented sources. The one called Moishe was open to impression and received the Law of One in its most simple form. However, the information became negatively oriented due to his people’s pressure to do specific physical things in the third-density planes. This left the entity open for the type of information and philosophy of a self-service nature.
- 16.20: It would be unlike an entity fully aware of the knowledge of the Law of One to ever say “Thou shalt not.”

**True and False Prophets**
15. “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
16. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
17. Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 
18. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
19. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
20. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.

**The Parable of the Sower**
3. Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. 
4. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 
5. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 
6. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 
7. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 
8. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 
9. Whoever has ears, let them hear.”
# Matthew 13:11-17
**Why speak in Parables**
11. He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
12. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.
13. This is why I speak to them in parables:
		“Though seeing, they do not see;  
	     though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
14. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:
		“‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding;  
			you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.  
15.         For this people’s heart has become calloused;  
			they hardly hear with their ears,  
			and they have closed their eyes.  
		Otherwise they might see with their eyes,  
		    hear with their ears,  
			understand with their hearts  
			and turn, and I would heal them.’
16. But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
17. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
# Matthew 13:18-23
**Explanation of Parable of the Sower**
18. “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:
19. When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
20. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
21. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
22. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.
23. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”

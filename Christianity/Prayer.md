# Power of Prayer
If one wishes to strengthen its prayer, then one must maintain a fully focused conscious mind and open heart during its prayer and perform the prayer in repetition - the repetition can be one in a continuous time period, or certain time during each day, but to note it is up to one's own choice that best fits them.

7.1: The service available for our offering to those who call us is equivalent to the square of the distortion/need of that calling divided by, or integrated with, the basic Law of One in its distortion indicating the free will of those who are not aware of the unity of creation.

7.3: The square is sequential â€” one, two, three, four, each squared by the next number.

7.4: If ten, only ten, entities on earth required your services how would you compute their call using this square rule?
-  **Ra:** We would square one ten sequential times, raising the number to the tenth square.

10.13: The call begins with one. This call is equal to infinity and is not, as you would say, counted. It is the cornerstone. The second call is added. The third call empowers or doubles the second, and so forth, each additional caller doubling or granting power to all the preceding call. Thus, the call of many of your peoples is many, many-powered and overwhelmingly heard to the infinite reaches of the One Creation.

14.24: Moreover, those who were not calling previously may, with great trauma, discover the answers to the call nearly simultaneously with their late call. There is no time/space in call.

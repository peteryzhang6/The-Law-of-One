# Spells and Chants

- the blessing of air and water: (speak these words with an empty heart)
	- You flow through me
	- Fill me with life
	- Cleanse me of death 
- the blessing of earth and fire: (of course you can find different ways that you resonate with air, water, earth and fire)
	- by earth, am i strengthened and stand tall
	- by fire, am i energized and rise high
	- by earth, do i feel strengthened and stand tall
	- by fire, do i feel energized and rise high
- the blessing of air (hot, moist)
	- a chant based on the hot and moist property of air, it is best to relate to one's experience of air
	- healing property of air can be find in moments of experience that brought joy
	- destructive property of air can be find in moments of experience that brought pain
	- writing down the full experience of joy and pain
		- then deducte the paragraphs of the experience into the major words of feeling to create the chant
		- to chant without chanting is to vividly recall the exact feeling of joy and/or pain 
- the blessing of water (cold, moist)
- the blessing of earth (cold, dry)
- the blessing of fire (hot, dry)
- blessing of the one/infinite: (can be infinte forms but to only list a few)
	- We Are One
	- One is All and All is One
	- I seek not two but one that is truly and eternal 
	- Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?
	- Good and bad are two faces of the same coin 
	- As above, so below
	- As I stare at the abyss, the abyss also stares back at me
	- Through the reflections of between us, may we find our true selves 
	- (any sound forms repeating)
		- Om.....
		- Em.....
		- Hm.....
	- any prayers said through the mouth but heard through the heart
- blessing of air/fire/earth (cigarettes) (hot,moist)/(hot,dry)/(cold,dry) = (hot,dry) = air bending
	- though fire and earth, do the air gives me warmth and energy

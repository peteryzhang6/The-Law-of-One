# Infinity
The universe is divided into the heavens, the hells, and the middle world so called human world 
- Trinity
	- In Christianity, The Father=heaven, The Son=man, The Holy Spirit=hell
	- In Law of One, Mind=heaven, Body=man, Soul=hell
	- In modern times, The Father=future, The Son=now, The Soul/Spirit=past
	- In Buddhism, The future buddha=son, the present buddha=parent, the past buddha=grandparents
	- In Science, The Father = north/south pole, The Son=magnet, The Holy Spirit=south/north pole
	- Note: try not to associate the term "good" with "heaven" and "bad" with "hell", but merely see it as the north and south pole of a magnet, of a duality
- to use this description along with the understanding of "as above, so below" or "when you stare at the abyss, the abyss also stares at you", one can see that the 7 chakras within human body is divided into:
	- lower 3 chakras as hells 
	- heart chakras as humans
	- upper 3 chakras as heavens 
- darkness, evil, pain, and sadness rises from the lower 3 chakras into the heart of human world
- light, life, joy, and happiness falls from the upper 3 chakras into the heart of human world 
- the conscious mind (i believe/think) lies not in the brain but born out of the voidness of heart (each beat of the heart is like a big bang of the universe)
	- to think through (draw upon the power of light to give) the brain can be seen as a top down approach
	- to think through (draw upon the power of dark to devour) the groin can be seen as a bottom up approach
	- to not think or intuition is to follow your heart (not sure)
		- yet for true good to come out of not thinking, one needs to open their hearts
		- if not, it is like a blind man not knowing good and bad
- to achieve wholeness or unity of oneself, one needs to find the corresponding darkness and light to cancel/unite each other within one's heart
	- if the darkness that is rising into one's heart is too much, then allow it to pass through the heart into the heavens	
		- as a way to fuel the guiding light (as water rises up a tree) and allows more light to fall 
	- if the light that is falling into one's heart is too much, then allow it to pass through the heart into the hells 
		- as a way to fuel the eternal fires (as light allows the tree's root to grow) and allows more fire to rise 
- the closing of the heart is labeled as STS or separation in Law of One
	- or can be seen as the separation of hells and heavens 
	- or in human world, the dark ages (many) or dark night of soul (one)
- in opening the heart, labeled as STO or unity in Law of One
	- is the unity of 3 worlds, and from the trinity, omni-potency is realized
	- or the golden ages
- hells can be seen as the yin and heavens as the yang in Dao
- in Buddhist, 悟空 means to realize the voidness within your heart
	- I see it as a cancellation of the forces of hell and heavens 
	- in Law of One, unity and in perfect unity, creates the symbol of the sun (☉) as the dot is the heart and the circle is the body or the skin and in between infinity
- the definition of Devil can be understood as closing of heart chakras and solely focusing on reaching the deepest hells and highest heavens
- the definition of God can be understood as opening of heart chakras and allow it to reach the deepest hells and highest heavens

To understand that infinity exists in all can be interrupted as such:
- that the Revelation of New Testament in bible is shown in a being's life, a plant's life, an animal's life, a specie's rise and fall, a person's life, an event from beginning to end, a corporation's rise and fall, a civilization's rise and fall, an angel's creation and fall, the cycle of life and death, and etc.
	- That the TuiBeiTu (推背图) is also like the Revelation of New Testament
	- That the 22 Major Arcana of Tarot is also like such
	- But simply in different orders due to a person, an event, an entity, a being, a collective's local configuration
- to see that any story that is heard or not heard yet is the Eternal One manifested in small and big
	- this story can be seen as any creation such as art, music, literatures, or even an act, or thought
- to see the progress of being in red ray into indigo ray into unity of violet ray or red ray of next octave in body, bodies, planet, planets, galaxy, galaxies, universe, and universes
- to understand that each entity plays a vital role within the environment it is in, no matter how big or small the entity is and no matter how big or small the impact of the entity is
	- to remove an entity within an environment but not seek to unite it creates separation
	- it is like to say certain cells within one's body is not needed thus removed can create unimagined pain 
		- it can also be said the mutation of cells into cancer cells is the result of separation, of separation of oneself from the true path of living
	- in confronting and understanding this pain, and to unite this pain within one, one can create a unity that is previously unimagined
- to remember Ra's words that 'black hole is a 3rd density manifestation of the beings that achieved total unity'

>13.5: The first known thing in the creation is infinity. The infinity is creation.

>13.6: Infinity became aware. This was the next step.

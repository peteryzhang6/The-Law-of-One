# Infinity

![[Session 1#1.7]]

Infinity = Unity. In Unity there is only One, thus [[The One Infinite Creator]], where one/infinite and infinite/one, just like light/love and [[Light-Love|love/light]]. I would assume Love matches Infinite and One matches Light. 

- [[Session 13#13.5]]: The first known thing in the creation is infinity. The infinity is creation.
- [[Session 13#13.6]]: Infinity became aware. This was the next step.

From the above two quotes, we can further understand "Creator" is another form of infinity. We can also understand the "Creator" is something that potentiate. Thus the One Infinite Creator can be further understand as a trinity of infinity where "One" can be the unity, "Infinite" can be the [[intelligent infinity]]/energy, "Creator" is the Logos, and the creation is the Light.

We are currently seeking a better understanding of unity or creation by using a distorted mind/body/spirit complex on Earth. These distortions are chosen by ourselves in a pre-incarnated state.

I believe Ra says "this distortion is not in any case necessary" in meaning that we are already within unity, thus how much more "united" can we be? Thus we become distorted and in our journey back to unity, we understand unity "better".

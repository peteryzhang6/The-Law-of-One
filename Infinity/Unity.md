# Unity
> [[Session 1#1.7]]
> That which is infinite cannot be many, for many-ness is a finite concept. To have [[My Understanding of Infinity]] you must identify or define that infinity as unity; otherwise, the term does not have any referent or meaning. In an Infinite Creator there is only unity. You have seen simple examples of unity. You have seen the prism which shows all colors stemming from the sunlight. This is a simplistic example of unity.

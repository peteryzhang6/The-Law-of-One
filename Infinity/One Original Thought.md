>Let us for a moment consider thought. What is it, my friends, to take thought? Took you then thought today? What thoughts did you think today? What thoughts were part of the original thought today? In how many of your thoughts did the creation abide? Was love contained? And was service freely given? You are not part of a material universe. You are part of a thought. You are dancing in a ballroom in which there is no material. You are dancing thoughts. You move your body, your mind, and your spirit in somewhat eccentric patterns for you have not completely grasped the concept that you are part of the original thought.  

**What is the One Original Thought?**
- To look it at the top most view, can be seen as the Infinite Creator's one original thought - to know itself 
- to look it at different sub Logos, of a sub Logos to know itself within the creations of the Infinite Creator through experience
- the 'loving' thought of to know itself creates self-awareness and consciousness

- "all things, all of life, all of the creation" can be seen as all there is in whatever form a being encounters.

With the understanding of [[Infinity]], we can understand that the unity of infinite thoughts of the One Infinite Creator is the One Original Thought that contains Love and Light.

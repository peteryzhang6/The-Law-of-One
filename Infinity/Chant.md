# Chant
Check [[Prayer]] on the purpose of chants.

#TODO I categorized to my best ability of chants into its respective consciousness density. Will need to create instructions on how to create personalized chants if one so have the distortion towards that.

15.14: We(Ra) can only encourage these lines of contemplation, always stating the prerequisite of meditation, contemplation, or prayer as a means of subjectively/objectively using or combining various understandings to enhance the seeking process. Without such a method of reversing the analytical process, one could not integrate into unity the many understandings gained in such seeking.
# 1D
Chants focused on the Beingness of [[1st Density]] consciousness
- the blessing of air and water: (speak these words with an open heart)
	- You flow through me
	- Fill me with life
	- Cleanse me of death 
- the blessing of earth and fire: (of course you can find different ways that you resonate with air, water, earth and fire)
	- by earth, am I strengthened and stand tall
	- by fire, am I energized and rise high
	- by earth, do I feel strengthened and stand tall
	- by fire, do I feel energized and rise high
- the blessing of air (hot, moist)
	- a chant based on the hot and moist property of air, it is best to relate to one's experience of air
	- healing property of air can be find in moments of experience that brought joy
	- destructive property of air can be find in moments of experience that brought pain
	- writing down the full experience of joy and pain
		- then deduct the paragraphs of the experience into the major words of feeling to create the chant
		- to chant without chanting is to vividly recall the exact feeling of joy and/or pain 
- the blessing of water (cold, moist)
- the blessing of earth (cold, dry)
- the blessing of fire (hot, dry)
- - blessing of air/fire/earth (cigarettes) (hot, moist)/(hot, dry)/(cold, dry) = (hot, dry) = air bending
	- though fire and earth, do the air gives me warmth and energy
# 2D
Chants focusing on the Movement of [[2nd Density]] consciousness
- talk to insects, animals and plants. lol
- [[LOO Crystal Healing]]
# 3D
Chants focusing on the Choice of [[3rd Density]] consciousness
- Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?
- Why? 
# 4D
Chants focusing on the Love and Compassion of [[4th Density]] consciousness
- [[Jesus Christ#Luke 11 2-4|Jesus' Prayer]]
# 5D
Chants focusing on the Light and Wisdom of [[5th Density]] consciousness
- [[ZIN-URU Mantra of Thoth the Atlantian.mp3]]
	- I put this here because of [[Thoth the Atlantean]] mentioned "power is wisdom and wisdom is power" and he said use the word "ZIN-URU" to find power.
	- Because of [[STO-STS#Service to self (STS)|STS 11.31]] where Ra mentioned distortion towards power is one of STS, thus to avoid subconsciously turning towards the negative, one needs to remember the words of Thoth - "Yet must ye understand that man is of Light and Light is of man." And thus replacing "power" with "light" - "light is wisdom and wisdom is light".
# 6D
Chants focusing on the Oneness of [[6th Density]] consciousness
- We Are One
- One is All and All is One
- I seek not two but one that is truly and eternal 
- Good and bad are two faces of the same coin 
- As above, so below
- As I stare at the abyss, the abyss also stares back at me
- Through the reflections between us, may we find our true selves 
# 7D
Chants focusing on the Foreverness of [[7th Density]] consciousness
- (any sound forms repeating)
	- Om.....
	- Em.....
	- Hm.....
# 8D
Chants focusing on personal evolution and a new sense of Beingness of [[8th Density]] consciousness

I don't know what chants can be categorized as 8D but I think it would be one of the act to learn new chants and gain new understanding. It would also be something of a phoenix. Maybe in consciousness term, of total forgetting and re-rememberance.

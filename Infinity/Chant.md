# Chant
Check [[Prayer]] on the purpose of chants.

Also check [[Magick Ritual]]

#TODO I categorized to my best ability of chants into its respective consciousness density. Will need to create instructions on how to create personalized chants if one so have the distortion towards that.

74.15: **Questioner:** If we had constructed a ritual of our own with words used for the first time in the sequence of protection what would have been the relative merit of this with respect to the ritual that we chose?

**Ra:** I am Ra. It would be less. In constructing ritual it is well to study the body of written work which is available for names of positive or service-to-others power are available.

74.17: **Questioner:** I assume that the reason that the rituals that have been used previously are of effect is that these words have built a bias in consciousness of those who have worked in these areas so that those who are of the distortion of mind that we seek will respond to the imprint in consciousness of these series of words. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is, to a great extent, correct. The exception is the sounding of some of what you call your Hebrew and some of what you call your Sanskrit vowels. These sound vibration complexes have power before time and space and represent configurations of light which built all that there is.

74.18: **Questioner:** Why do these sounds have this property?

**Ra:** I am Ra. The correspondence in vibratory complex is mathematical.

74.19: **Questioner:** How did the users of these sounds, Sanskrit and Hebrew, determine what these sounds were?

**Ra:** I am Ra. In the case of the Hebrew that entity known as Yahweh aided this knowledge through impression upon the material of genetic coding which became language, as you call it.  
  
In the case of Sanskrit the sound vibrations are pure due to the lack of previous what you call alphabet or letter-naming. Thus the sound vibration complexes seemed to fall into place as from the Logos. This was a more, shall we say, natural or unaided situation or process.  
  
We would at this time make note of the incident in the previous working where our contact was incorrectly placed for a short period and was then corrected. In the exercise of the fire you may see the initial spiral clockwise from the green-ray energy center, through the shoulders and head, then through the elbows, then to the left hand. The channel had been corrected before the remainder of this answer was completed.

75.26: **Questioner:** You spoke in a previous session about certain Hebrew and Sanskrit sound vibratory complexes being powerful because they were mathematically related to that which was the creation. Could you expand on this understanding, please, as to how these are linked?

**Ra:** I am Ra. As we previously stated the linkage is mathematical or that of the ratio. You may consider it musical. There are those whose mind complex activities would attempt to resolve this mathematical ratio but at present the coloration of the intoned vowel is part of the vibration which cannot be accurately measured. However, it is equivalent to types of rotation of your primary material particles.

75.27: **Questioner:** If these sounds are precisely vibrated then what effect or use would they have with respect to the purposes of the adept?

**Ra:** I am Ra. You may consider the concept of sympathetic resonance. When certain sounds are correctly vibrated, the creation sings.

75.28: **Questioner:** Would these sounds, then, be of a musical nature in that there would be a musical arrangement of many different sound vibrations, or would this apply to just one single note? Or which would it apply more to?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This query is not easily answered. In some cases only the intoned vowel has effect. In other cases, most notably Sanskrit combinations, the selection of harmonic intervals is also of resonant nature.

15.14: We(Ra) can only encourage these lines of contemplation, always stating the prerequisite of meditation, contemplation, or prayer as a means of subjectively/objectively using or combining various understandings to enhance the seeking process. Without such a method of reversing the analytical process, one could not integrate into unity the many understandings gained in such seeking.
# 1D
Chants focused on the Beingness of [[1st Density]] consciousness
- the blessing of air and water: (speak these words with an open heart)
	- You flow through me
	- Fill me with life
	- Cleanse me of death 
- the blessing of earth and fire: (of course you can find different ways that you resonate with air, water, earth and fire)
	- by earth, am I strengthened and stand tall
	- by fire, am I energized and rise high
	- by earth, do I feel strengthened and stand tall
	- by fire, do I feel energized and rise high
- the blessing of air (hot, moist)
	- a chant based on the hot and moist property of air, it is best to relate to one's experience of air
	- healing property of air can be find in moments of experience that brought joy
	- destructive property of air can be find in moments of experience that brought pain
	- writing down the full experience of joy and pain
		- then deduct the paragraphs of the experience into the major words of feeling to create the chant
		- to chant without chanting is to vividly recall the exact feeling of joy and/or pain 
- the blessing of water (cold, moist)
- the blessing of earth (cold, dry)
- the blessing of fire (hot, dry)
- blessing of air/fire/earth (cigarettes) (hot, moist)/(hot, dry)/(cold, dry) = (hot, dry) = air bending
	- though fire and earth, do the air gives me warmth and energy
# 2D
Chants focusing on the Movement of [[2nd Density]] consciousness
- talk to insects, animals and plants. lol
- [[LOO Crystal Healing]]
# 3D
Chants focusing on the Choice of [[3rd Density]] consciousness
- Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing?
- Why? 
# 4D
Chants focusing on the Love and Compassion of [[4th Density]] consciousness
- [[Jesus Christ#Luke 11 2-4|Jesus' Prayer]]
# 5D
Chants focusing on the Light and Wisdom of [[5th Density]] consciousness
- [[ZIN-URU Mantra of Thoth the Atlantian.mp3]]
	- I put this here because of [[Thoth the Atlantean]] mentioned "power is wisdom and wisdom is power" and he said use the word "ZIN-URU" to find power.
	- Because of [[STO-STS#Service to self (STS)|STS 11.31]] where Ra mentioned distortion towards power is one of STS, thus to avoid subconsciously turning towards the negative, one needs to remember the words of Thoth - "Yet must ye understand that man is of Light and Light is of man." And thus replacing "power" with "light" - "light is wisdom and wisdom is light".
# 6D
Chants focusing on the Oneness of [[6th Density]] consciousness
- We Are One
- One is All and All is One
- I seek not two but one that is truly and eternal 
- Good and bad are two faces of the same coin 
- As above, so below
- As I stare at the abyss, the abyss also stares back at me
- Through the reflections between us, may we find our true selves 
# 7D
Chants focusing on the Foreverness of [[7th Density]] consciousness
- (any sound forms repeating)
	- Om.....
	- Em.....
	- Hm.....
# 8D
Chants focusing on personal evolution and a new sense of Beingness of [[8th Density]] consciousness

I don't know what chants can be categorized as 8D but I think it would be one of the act to learn new chants and gain new understanding. It would also be something of a phoenix. Maybe in consciousness term, of total forgetting and re-rememberance.

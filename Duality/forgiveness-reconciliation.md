Forgiveness is the manifestation of inner to outer force while reconciliation is the manifestation of outer to inner force.

- using an example of a good person vs a bad person 
	- the bad person hurts the good person, the good person first reconcile within oneself then outwards shows forgiveness to the bad person 
	- the good person forgives the sin of bad person, the bad person first is forgiven by the other self from without, and then within able to reconcile with oneself
	- the bad person achieves unity through the conscious choice of accepting the forgiveness from outside, then stops its action, then reconciles within 
	- the good person achieves unity through the conscious choice of accepting the pain, reconcile within, then outputs forgiveness 
	- the bad person becomes good when it stops its evil doing when it hears forgiveness/reconcile
	- the good person becomes bad when it continues its good doing when it keeps in reconcile/forgiveness 
	- a delicate balance and one arduous road one walks yet within is the eternal
- the same with 慈悲/包容

# Forgiveness and Reconciliation
**慈悲-和解**

Forgiveness is the manifestation of inner to outer force while reconciliation is the manifestation of outer to inner force.

- using an example of a good person vs a bad person 
	- the bad person hurts the good person, the good person first reconcile within oneself then outwards shows forgiveness to the bad person 
	- the good person forgives the sin of bad person, the bad person first is forgiven by the other self from without, and then within able to reconcile with oneself
	- the bad person achieves unity through the conscious choice of accepting the forgiveness from outside, then stops its action, then reconciles within 
	- the good person achieves unity through the conscious choice of accepting the pain, reconcile within, then outputs forgiveness 
	- the bad person becomes good when it stops its evil doing when it hears forgiveness/reconcile
	- the good person becomes bad when it continues its good doing when it keeps in reconcile/forgiveness 
	- a delicate balance and one arduous road one walks yet within is the eternal
- the same with 慈悲/包容

17.20: In [[Forgiveness-Reconciliation|forgiveness]] lies the stoppage of the wheel of action, or what you call [[Karma]].
- [[Jesus Christ#Luke 11 2-4]]

18.12: Forgiveness of other-self is forgiveness of self. An understanding of this insists upon full forgiveness upon the conscious level of self and other-self, for they are one. A full forgiveness is thus impossible without the inclusion of self.

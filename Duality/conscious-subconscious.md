#TODO

To note the conscious and subconscious is referring to that one of mind:
- the conscious mind
- the subconscious mind

The conscious mind can be seen as the mind of a waking person who actively choose certain actions. 
The subconscious mind can be seen as the passive reactive force of the person without the active choosing.


#time/space *conscious/subconscious* can be seen as a person going to sleep. The being's conscious travels from 3D real world into the dream world, or as Ra said going from realm of time/space into realm of space/time.

#space/time *subconscious/conscious* can be seen as a person waking up. The conscious mind returns from dream world into 3D world, from space/time to time/space.

# assumptions
The subconscious mind is in potential at all times. 

The conscious mind, which is of 3D, is activated at the waking moments for a person.

The conscious mind is only of one, of the Creator, while the subconscious can be infinitely many. The conscious mind of a [social memory complex](social%20memory%20complex) is one of many conscious minds of Creators becoming co-Creators with others.

Because of the observer or the Creator is traveling between two universes, thus memories in each universes will not be carried fully, but only the nature of the Creator or the soul is preserved. Thus can explain the connection of events in reality and dream.

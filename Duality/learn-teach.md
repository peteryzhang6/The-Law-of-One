# Learn and Teach
1.10: Thus, to learn is the same as to teach unless you are not teaching what you are learning, in which case you have done you/they little or no good. This understanding should be pondered by your mind/body/spirit complex, as it is a distortion which plays a part in your experiences at this nexus.

2.1: To teach/learn is the Law of One in one of its most elementary distortions.

# Learn/Teach 
is an entity called student, who first study the knowledge from the outside then later apply the knowledge to real life.

>8.16: They used his mind/body/spirit complexâ€™s life experience, concentrating upon the experience of the complexes of what you call war.
- The "they" is referring to third-density beings of a fairly high order of the Sirius galaxy. (8.21-22)

>8.17: The use of experience is to learn. Consider a race who watches a movie. It experiences a story and identifies with the feelings, perceptions, and experiences of the hero.

>8.20: We ourselves, when we chose a mission among your peoples, needed to study your peoples for had we arrived in no other form than our own, we would have been perceived as light.

# Teach/Learn 
is an entity called teacher, who first teach the knowledge it knows then later learn from its mistake and reflect on the mistake for refinement and improvement.

9.3: I am Ra. Again, to direct your judgment is an intrusion upon your space/time continuum distortion called future. To speak of past or present within our distortion/judgment limits is acceptable. To guide rather than teach/learn is not acceptable to our distortion in regards to teach/learning.

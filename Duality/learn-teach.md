# Learn and Teach
1.10: Thus, to learn is the same as to teach unless you are not teaching what you are learning, in which case you have done you/they little or no good. This understanding should be pondered by your mind/body/spirit complex, as it is a distortion which plays a part in your experiences at this nexus.

2.1: To teach/learn is the Law of One in one of its most elementary distortions.

17.2:
- It is impossible to help another being directly. It is only possible to make catalyst available in whatever form, the most important being the radiation of realization of oneness with the Creator from the self, less important being information such as we share with you.
- We, ourselves, do not feel an urgency for this information to be widely disseminated. It is enough that we have made it available to three, four, or five. This is extremely ample reward, for if one of these obtains fourth-density understanding due to this catalyst then we shall have fulfilled the Law of One in the distortion of service.
- We encourage a dispassionate attempt to share information without concern for numbers or quick growth among others. That you attempt to make this information available is, in your term, your service. The attempt, if it reaches one, reaches all.
- We cannot offer shortcuts to enlightenment. Enlightenment is of the moment, is an opening to intelligent infinity. It can only be accomplished by the self, for the self. Another self cannot teach/learn enlightenment, but only teach/learn information, inspiration, or a sharing of love, of mystery, of the unknown that makes the other-self reach out and begin the seeking process that ends in a moment, but who can know when an entity will open the gate to the present?
# Learn/Teach 
is an entity called student, who first study the knowledge from the outside then later apply the knowledge to real life.

>8.16: They used his mind/body/spirit complexâ€™s life experience, concentrating upon the experience of the complexes of what you call war.
- The "they" is referring to third-density beings of a fairly high order of the Sirius galaxy. (8.21-22)

>8.17: The use of experience is to learn. Consider a race who watches a movie. It experiences a story and identifies with the feelings, perceptions, and experiences of the hero.

>8.20: We ourselves, when we chose a mission among your peoples, needed to study your peoples for had we arrived in no other form than our own, we would have been perceived as light.

>10.11: While an entity is incarnate in the [[3rd Density]] at this time (1981) he may learn without consciously knowing what he's doing. Or he may learn after he is consciously aware that he is learning in the ways of the Law of One and has the possibility of greatly accelerate his growth.

>10.12: The Law of One has as one of its [[Primal Distortion]] the free will distortion, thus each entity is free to accept, reject, or ignore the mind/body/spirit complexes about it and ignore the creation itself. There are many among your social memory complex distortion who, at this time/space, engage daily, as you would put it, in the working upon the Law of One in one of its primal distortions; that is, the ways of love. However, if this same entity, being biased from the depths of its mind/body/spirit complex towards love/light, were then to accept responsibility for each moment of the time/space accumulation of present moments available to it, such an entity can empower its progress in much the same way as we described the empowering of the call of your social complex distortion to the Confederation.
- *were then to accept responsibility for each moment of the time/space accumulation of present moments available to it* - love every moment; give thanks to each moment, give thanks for the [[Jesus Christ#Luke 11 2-4|daily bread]]
# Teach/Learn 
is an entity called teacher, who first teach the knowledge it knows then later learn from its mistake and reflect on the mistake for refinement and improvement.

9.3: I am Ra. Again, to direct your judgment is an intrusion upon your space/time continuum distortion called future. To speak of past or present within our distortion/judgment limits is acceptable. To guide rather than teach/learn is not acceptable to our distortion in regards to teach/learning.

15.13: It is important to allow each seeker to enlighten itself rather than for any messenger to attempt in language to teach/learn for the entity, thus being teach/learner and learn/teacher. This is not in balance with your third density. We learn from you. We teach to you. Thus, we teach/learn. If we learned for you, this would cause imbalance in the direction of the distortion of free will.

Exercise One. This is the most nearly centered and usable within your illusion complex. The moment contains love. That is the lesson/goal of this illusion or density. The exercise is to consciously seek that love in awareness and understanding distortions. The first attempt is the cornerstone. Upon this choosing rests the remainder of the life-experience of an entity. The second seeking of love within the moment begins the addition. The third seeking powers the second, the fourth powering or doubling the third. As with the previous type of empowerment, there will be some loss of power due to flaws within the seeking in the distortion of insincerity. However, the conscious statement of self to self of the desire to seek love is so central an act of will that, as before, the loss of power due to this friction is inconsequential.  
  
Exercise Two. The universe is one being. When a mind/body/spirit complex views another mind/body/spirit complex, see the Creator. This is an helpful exercise.  
  
Exercise Three. Gaze within a mirror. See the Creator.  
  
Exercise Four. Gaze at the creation which lies about the mind/body/spirit complex of each entity. See the Creator.  
  
The foundation or prerequisite of these exercises is a predilection towards what may be called meditation, contemplation, or [[Prayer]]. With this attitude, these exercises can be processed. Without it, the data will not sink down into the roots of the tree of mind, thus enabling and ennobling the body and touching the spirit.

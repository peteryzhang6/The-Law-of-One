# Learn and Teach
1.10: Thus, to learn is the same as to teach unless you are not teaching what you are learning, in which case you have done you/they little or no good. This understanding should be pondered by your mind/body/spirit complex, as it is a distortion which plays a part in your experiences at this nexus.

2.1: To teach/learn is the Law of One in one of its most elementary distortions.

**Learn/teach** is an entity called student, who first study the knowledge from the outside then later apply the knowledge to real life.

**Teach/learn** is an entity called teacher, who first teach the knowledge it knows then later learn from its mistake and reflect on the mistake for refinement and improvement.

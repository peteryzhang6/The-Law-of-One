# How should STO treat STS
Like Ra said, with Love and Light.

It is difficult to treat STSs with Love and Light as an initiate of STOs, but to understand and in knowing of that STS will eventually end in 6D and turn to 6D STO: for those (STSs) who use me to their own gain, I worry not. For I know the road they walk is one of dead ends, of death For I have travelled that path many times. So I help them and accelerate their journey that has an end. I shall help them to progress their journey and fast shall I accelerate their journey that within moments do they reach their destination. Oh how much do they celebrate at me surrendering at their power, but oh so foolishly do they believe that the road they walk is one to eternal life. I wait, wait till the day they reach their final destination. And it is called "final destination" for a reason, the "final" is the end of their road, of their life, of all their "achievements" they so dearly hold on to. It is nothing but an illusion, for they chose to walk the road of illusion and thus do they met the end of illusion - The Final, the Death, for Final Death is also an merely illusion that exists in the all wisdom and love of Infinity. And then do I see they turn and walk the path of truth, the one that I never left and neither did they. LOL #infinity #unity

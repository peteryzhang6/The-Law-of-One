# Judge and Reflect
Judgement (judge/reflect) is an inward to outward force of one's understanding of self projected outward onto other selves then later when reflect comes, the judgement will be returned onto oneself.

Reflection (reflect/judge) is an outward to inward force of one's understanding of self being reflected back onto oneself by other selves and when this understanding is reflected back onto other selves, it becomes judgement of other selves by other selves.

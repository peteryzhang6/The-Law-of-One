0950: As I was going out for a smoke, I told my dad a quote I came up on the spot:
```
When you tell a dumbass who is pretending to be smart, 'You are a dumbass', he will get angry.
When you tell a genius who is pretending to be dumb, 'You are a dumbass', he will laugh.
```

The following logic is used to explain the above quote.
A person consists of duality, of [yin/yang](yang-yin.md), of smart and stupid.
A smart person is a genius and a stupid person is a dumbass.
Like an apple tree begets apples and orange tree begets oranges.
Like the human nature that we laugh at the things that bring us joy and cry at the things that bring us sadness.
A dumbass pretending to be a genius is a being of yin/yang.
A genius pretending to be a dumbass is a being of yang/yin.
Due to this property:
- when a dumbass pretends to be a genius (yin/yang) and 
	- is given yin (told of being dumb), it will produce yin (madness), of its nature.
	- is given yang (told of being smart), it will produce yang (joy), unlike of its nature
- when a genius pretends to be a dumbass (yang/yin) and 
	- is given yin (told of being dumb), it will produce yin (laugh), unlike of its nature
	- is given yang (told of being smart), it will produce yang (madness), of its nature
- To note this is only a generalization or idealization in a purified state.
For one to become conscious and understood the nature of yin and yang:
- it is of one's choice to choose when received yin or yang, should yin or yang be returned
It is also of one's choice to choose to not return neither yin or yang in order for the nature of the giver to be shown
For example: 
- When person A offers person B goods, and B returned nothing. Then person A starts to say things like: "Where is my thank you?" "You are a greedy person." "I will never gave you anything" and did so. Then it is clear that person A in this moment is a selfish person pretending to be selfless. #yang/yin
- When person A offers person B goods, and B returned nothing. Then person A starts to say things like: "I will bring you more goods when you run out." and did so. Then it is clear that person A in this moment is a selfless person showing its true self. #yin/yin
- When person A takes goods away from person B, and B returned nothing. Then person A starts to say things like: "This person did not protect his good and I will take more from him." and did so. Then it is clear that person A in this moment is a selfish person showing its true self. #yin/yang
- When person A takes goods away from person B, and B returned nothing. Then person A starts to say things like: "You did nothing while I took from you. I thank you. So too shall I share my goods with you" and did so. Then it is clear that person A in this moment is a selfless person pretending to be selfish. #yang/yang

But again to note the above example is an expansion on yin and yang, from 2 to 4. But situations in reality is that of 8, 16, 32, to infinity. Thus much more information is needed to reduce infinity back down to 8, to 4, to 2, and to 1.

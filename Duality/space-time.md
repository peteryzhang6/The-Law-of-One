# Space and Time
In Law of One, Ra coupled space and time together, and a reason I understand this as:
- When we are going to a place, the space is decided by point A and point B, thus we need to figure out the time it takes to travel from point A to point B. Thus space/time.
- When we only have 1 hour for lunch, we then think about from our point A of a radius of 1 hour time to decide a point B for lunch. Thus time/space.

Ra mentions that the world we are in is mainly of *time/space* where we focus our mind on the change of time, thus I interpret that the dream world is that of *space/time* as in dreams we rarely notice time, but focus our mind on the change in space.

To overcome the restraint of space and time, I believe one should first start with the mind, by telling oneself the things below before taking the action:
- "For I hold the key to space and time thus I consciously choose:"
	- to create the space and time for writing - my desk with computer on it
	- to create the space and time for sleeping - my bed 
	- to create the space and time for smoking - balcony or outside
		- to calm myself
		- to relax myself
		- to enjoy the moment
		- to ...
	- to create the space and time for eating - dinning room
	- to create the space and time for playing 
	- to create the space and time for learning
	- to create the space and time for teaching
	- to create the space and time for actions and activity
	- to create the space and time for Love and Light
	- to create the space and time for Oneness
	- to create the space and time for Eternal Life
- "For I hold the key to space and time thus I consciously choose not:"
	- to create the space and time for destruction
	- to create the space and time for separation
	- to create the space and time for death
-  "For I hold the key to life and death thus I consciously choose:"
	- to create the space and time within me to unite pain and joy
	- to create the space and time within me to turn old death into new life

#6/9 **Ra:** Do you request space/time present information or space/time continuum information?
- what is the difference between present information and continuum information?

# Duality
The files in this Duality folder will be consist of two terms of outer opposite polarity or two terms of inner opposite polarity, such as:
```
Terms of outer opposite polarity:
light/dark
up/down
high/low
give/take

Terms of inner opposite polarity:
let/make
forgiveness/reconciliation
light/love
shadow/void (?)
```

The name scheme of the files will be in alphabetical order such as: (because in file names cannot contain '/')
```
dark-light.md
down-up.md
high-low.md
```

**To note**: There can also be files with single term. This happens when I cannot find a good word of opposite polarity or consciously choose to leave it as a single term named file.

To remember that the format of (term1)/(term2) can be flipped to (term2)/(term1), the usage of such term within each file can be seen as:
```
light/dark : the light turning into darkness
dark/light : the darkness turning into light

teach/learn : through teaching of others, one learns from others about oneself and others
learn/teach : through learning from others, one is able to teach oneself and others

up/down : looking from up to down or looking downward
down/up : looking from down to up or looking upward
```

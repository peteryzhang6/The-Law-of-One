# Light and Love
How I understand what love and light is and I will use the Sun as an example:
- The light is the outward force of the Infinite Creator. The sunlight of the Sun produces and brightens its surroundings.
- The love is the inward force of the Infinite Creator. The gravity of the Sun that hold onto all its surroundings.

That each one of us is a entity of light/love and love/light:
- light/love - we use the outward expression of action and of speech to impact our surroundings, then we absorb the effects of our impact through our eyes, ears, nose, tastes, and touches.
- love/light - we use the inward expression of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feelings to pull the effects of our surrounding into ourselves, then we express these effects through our actions and speech to our surroundings.

15.22: There is the same difference between love/light and light/love as there is between teach/learning and learn/teaching. Love/light is the enabler, the power, the energy giver. Light/love is the manifestation which occurs when light has been impressed with love.
- Check [[Learn-Teach]]

With the understanding from [[Space-Time]] that space/time is the physical manifestation and time/space is the metaphysical manifestation, we can assume that
- light/love is the physical manifestation
- love/light is the metaphysical manifestation

29.16: Can you tell me how the gravity comes about?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. This that you speak of as [[gravity]] may be seen as the pressing towards the inner light/love, the seeking towards the spiral line of light which progresses towards the Creator. This is a manifestation of a spiritual event or condition of livingness.

29.17: Now, gravity we know now on our moon is less than it is upon our planet here. Is there a metaphysical principle behind this that you could explain?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. The metaphysical and physical are inseparable. Thus that of which you spoke which attempts to explain this phenomenon is able to, shall we say, calculate the gravitational force of most objects due to the various physical aspects such as what you know of as mass. However, we felt it was necessary to indicate the corresponding and equally important metaphysical nature of gravity.

29.18: The gravity, shall we say, the attractive force which we also describe as the pressing outward force towards the Creator is greater spiritually upon the entity you call Venus due to the greater degree of success, shall we say, at seeking the Creator.
- This point only becomes important when you consider that when all of creation in its infinity has reached a spiritual gravitational mass of sufficient nature, the entire creation infinitely coalesces; the light seeking and finding its source and thusly ending the creation and beginning a new creation much as you consider the [[black hole]], as you call it, with its conditions of infinitely great mass at the zero point from which no light may be seen as it has been absorbed.

29.19: Then the black hole would be a pointâ€¦ am I correct in saying it would be a point at which the environmental material had succeeded in uniting with unity or the Creator? Is this correct?
- **Ra:** I am Ra. The black hole which manifests third density is the physical complex manifestation of this spiritual or metaphysical state. This is correct.

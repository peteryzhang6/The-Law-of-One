# Light and Love
How I understand what love and light is and I will use the Sun as an example:
- The light is the outward force of the Infinite Creator. The sunlight of the Sun produces and brightens its surroundings.
- The love is the inward force of the Infinite Creator. The gravity of the Sun that hold onto all its surroundings.

That each one of us is a entity of light/love and love/light:
- light/love - we use the outward expression of action and of speech to impact our surroundings, then we absorb the effects of our impact through our eyes, ears, nose, tastes, and touches.
- love/light - we use the inward expression of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feelings to pull the effects of our surrounding into ourselves, then we express these effects through our actions and speech to our surroundings.

The unity of the love and the light within each of us can be seen in DaoTeChing's term as WuWei (无为).

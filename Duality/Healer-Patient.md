# Healer and Patient
A primal distortion in Law of One.
- 4.20: One of the primal distortions of the Law of One is that of healing.
- 15.14: You have been given information upon healing, as you call this distortion.
# 4.9
**Questioner:** Is it possible for you to instruct healing techniques if we could make available these individuals that have the native ability?

**Ra:** I am Ra. It is possible. We must add that many systems of teach/learning the healing/patient nexus are proper given various mind/body/spirit complexes. We ask your imagination to consider the relative simplicity of the mind in the earlier cycle and the less distorted, but often overly complex, views and thought/spirit processes of the same mind/body/spirit complexes after many incarnations. 

We also ask your imagination to conceive of those who have chosen the distortion of service and have removed their mind/body/spirit complexes from one dimension to another, thus bringing with them in sometimes totally latent form many skills and understandings which more closely match the distortions of the healing/patient processes.
# Who can heal
4.9: Everyone has the potential to heal because "many systems of teach/learning the healing/patient nexus are proper given various mind/body/spirit complexes.

4.9: We ask your imagination to consider the relative simplicity of the mind in the earlier cycle and the less distorted, but often overly complex, views and thought/spirit processes of the same mind/body/spirit complexes after many incarnations.
- Interpretation: The ways for an entity to teach/learn the healing/patient grows more and more complex as its number of incarnation increases. 
- In a worldly view, this can be an entity is clueless and worried about the wounds of others
	- Then due to the desire to comfort the other, this entity might first begin to use its voice and body language to calm the pain of other
	- However, the voice and body language can only do so much, this drives the entity to look for herbs to create medicines to directly treat the wound
	- But the emotional pain or the wound of the mind (PTSD) is still left within the patient, thus drives the entity to seek within the mind to treat the pain
	- Furthermore, through many incarnations, the entity began to see the wound of the spirit, which is the accumulated pain over many incarnations; thus the entity will seek to heal the spirit

4.9: At first the ability of healing maybe hidden to the entity. In order to awaken or activate the ability to heal, one will need to "chosen the distortion of service and have removed one's mind/body/spirit complexes from one dimension to another, thus bringing with them in sometimes totally latent form many skills and understandings which more closely match the distortions of the healing/patient processes."
- The act of choosing the distortion of service is one of [[STO-STS|STO]]
- The act of removing oneself from one dimension to another can be seen in the previous paragraph about the example of of an entity's attempt to heal others. It first must remove itself from the current dimension of worry and step into a new dimension where the healing/patient process is possible.

17.18:
Those who heal may be of any density which has the consciousness of the spirit. This includes third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh. The third density can be one in which healing takes place just as the others. However, there is more illusory material to understand, to balance, to accept, and to move forward from.  
  
The gate to [[intelligent infinity]] can only be opened when an understanding of the instreamings of intelligent energy are opened unto the healer. These are the so-called Natural Laws of your local space/time continuum and its web of electromagnetic sources or nexi of instreaming energy.  
  
Know then, first, the mind and the body. Then as the spirit is integrated and synthesized, those are harmonized into a mind/body/spirit complex which can move among the dimensions and which can open the gateway to intelligent infinity, thus healing self by light and sharing that light with others.  
  
True healing is simply the radiance of the self causing an environment in which a catalyst may occur which initiates the recognition of self, by self, of the self-healing properties of the self.
# 4-13
**Questioner:** I’m assuming, then, that the selected individual (who has the potential to heal) would necessarily be one who was very much in harmony with the Law of One. Though he may not have any intellectual understanding of it, he should be living the Law of One. Is this correct?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is both correct and incorrect. The first case, that being correctness, would apply to one such as the questioner itself who has the distortion towards healing, as you call it.  
- Applying that the questioner is living the Law of One but does not have intellectual understanding of Law of One. 
  
The incorrectness which shall be observed is the healing of those whose activities in your space/time illusion do not reflect the Law of One, but whose ability has found its pathway to intelligent infinity regardless of the plane of existence from which this distortion is found.
- *those whose activities in your space/time illusion do not reflect the Law of One* - from a POV of the healer
- *whose ability has found its path way to intelligent infinity* - the healer
- what is *this distortion*? - the distortion on activities do not reflect the Law of One by the healer
- I think the part of wrongness is that because of the infinite possibility of intelligent infinity, that all is already perfect, all is one as from the POV of Ra, then because one has the desire or distortion to see others as those who do not reflect the Law of One, thus allowed one to travel to a plane of existence where for oneself to experience the 'disharmony' of Law of One of others. (???)
# 4.14
**Questioner:** (Aside: Jim, did you understand?) I’m a little confused. I partially understood you; I’m not sure that I fully understood you. Could you restate that in another way?

**Ra:** Two kinds there are who can heal: those such as yourself who, having the innate distortion towards knowledge-giving of the Law of One, can heal but do not; and those who, having the same knowledge, but showing no significant distortion consciously towards the Law of One in mind, body, or spirit, yet and nevertheless have opened a channel to the same ability.  
  
The point being that there are those who, without proper training, shall we say, nevertheless, heal. It is a further item of interest that those whose life does not equal their work may find some difficulty in absorbing the energy of intelligent infinity and thus become quite distorted in such a way as to cause disharmony in themselves and others and perhaps even find it necessary to cease the healing activity. Therefore, those of the first type, those who seek to serve and are willing to be trained in thought, word, and action are those who will be able to comfortably maintain the distortion towards service in the area of healing.

# 12.31 Self-healing
The self-healing distortion is effected through realization of the intelligent infinity resting within. This is blocked in some way in those who are not perfectly balanced in bodily complexes. The blockage varies from entity to entity. It requires the conscious awareness of the spiritual nature of reality, if you will, and the corresponding pourings of this reality into the individual mind/body/spirit complex for healing to take place.  
  
We will use this instrument as example. The portions of its ailment, as you call this distortion complex, that can be perfected in balance are due primarily to a blockage of the indigo-ray or pineal energy center. This center receives the intelligent energy from all sources lawful within the one Creation; that is, lawful in this third-density distortion or illusion. If there is no blockage, these energies pour or stream down into the mind/body/spirit complex perfecting moment by moment the individual’s body complex.  
  
This instrument also experiences some distortion of the green-ray energy center which you may call the heart center. It is overly open due to an intensive desire distortion on the part of this mind/body/spirit complex towards service to others, or as you may call it, universal love. This entity, therefore, spends itself without regard to its reserves of mind/body/spirit complex distortion in regard to what you call strength or energy. This distortion is primarily due to the blockage of the indigo ray. As we have said before, the misapprehension distortion of the instrument responsible for this blockage is the basic orientation towards a belief in unworthiness. The unworthiness distortion blocks the free flow of intelligent energy.
  
The seventh or violet ray is unimpaired, this being not only an energy receptor but a sum total of the vibratory level of the individual. The other energy centers are also quite clear. The solution to healing in this case is action that puts into practice the peaceful understanding in humility distortion that the entity is one with the Creator, therefore perfected and not separate. In each case of what you would call ill health one or more of these energy centers is blocked. The intelligence of the mind/body/spirit complex needs then to be alerted either by the self as healer or by the catalyst of another healer, as we have said before.
# Three Steps of Healing  
4.20 One item which may be of interest is that a healer asking to learn must take the distortion understood as responsibility for that ask/receiving, thus healing. This is an honor/duty which must be carefully considered in free will before the asking.

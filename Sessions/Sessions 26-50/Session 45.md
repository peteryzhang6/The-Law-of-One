# 45.0 
Ra: I am Ra. I greet you in the love and in the light of the One Infinite Creator. We communicate now.

# 45.1
Questioner: Could you give us an estimate of the instrument’s physical condition for communications now that she is rested?

Ra: I am Ra. This instrument’s condition as regards the bodily complex is extremely poor. This instrument is not rested. However, this instrument was eager for our contact.

# 45.2 
Questioner: Did the period of abstinence from contact help the instrument’s physical condition?

Ra: I am Ra. This is correct. The probability of this instrument’s development of what you would call disease either of the pulmonary nature or the renal nature was quite significant at our previous contact. You have averted a possible serious physical malfunction of this instrument’s bodily complex. It is to be noted that your prayerful support was helpful as was this instrument’s unflagging determination to accept that which was best in the long run and thus maintain the exercises recommended without undue impatience. It is to be further noted that those things which aid this instrument are in some ways contradictory and require balance. Thus this instrument is aided by rest but also by diversions of an active nature. This makes it more difficult to aid this instrument. However, once this is known, the balancing may be more easily accomplished.

# 45.3
Questioner: Can you tell me if a large percentage of the Wanderers here now are those of Ra?

Ra: I am Ra. I can.

# 45.4 
Questioner: Are they?

Ra: I am Ra. A significant portion of sixth-density Wanderers are those of our social memory complex. Another large portion consists of those who aided those in South America; another portion, those aiding Atlantis. All sixth density and all brother and sister groups due to the unified feeling that as we had been aided by shapes such as the pyramid, so we could aid your peoples.

# 45.5
Questioner: Can you say if any of the three of us are of Ra or one of the other groups?

Ra: I am Ra. Yes.

# 45.6 
Questioner: Can you say which of us are of which group?

Ra: I am Ra. No.

# 45.7 
Questioner: Are all of us of one of the groups that you mentioned?

Ra: I am Ra. We shall go to the limits of our attempts to refrain from infringement. Two are a sixth-density origin, [water truck engine noise in background] one a fifth-density harvestable to sixth but choosing to [truck honk] return as a Wanderer due to a loving association between teacher and student. Thus you three [honk honk] form a greatly cohesive group.

# 45.8 
Questioner: Can you explain the right and left ear tone and what I call touch contact that I continually get?

Ra: I am Ra. [Doorbell in background.] This has been covered previously. Please ask for specific further details. [Truck engine turned off.]

# 45.9 
Questioner: I get what I consider to be a tickling in my right and my left ear at different times. Is this any different as far as meaning goes as the tone I get in my right and left ear?

Ra: I am Ra. No.

# 45.10 
Questioner: Why is the left ear of the service-to-self contact and the right service-to-others?

Ra: I am Ra. The nature of your physical vehicle is that there is a magnetic field positive and negative in complex patterns about the shells of your vehicle. The left portion of the head region of most entities is, upon the time/space continuum level, of a negative polarity.

# 45.11 
Questioner: Can you tell me the purpose or philosophy behind the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-density positive [bang outside] and negative social memory complexes? [Loud rapping at the door.]

Ra: I am Ra. [Bang outside.] The basic purpose [loud rapping] of a social memory complex is that of evolution. Beyond a certain point the evolution of spirit is quite dependent upon the understanding of self and other-self as Creator. This constitutes the basis for social complexes. When brought to maturity, they become social memory complexes. The fourth density and sixth density find these quite necessary. The fifth positive uses social memory [more rapping] in attaining wisdom, though this is done individually. In fifth negative much is done without aid of others. This is [doorbell in background] the last query as this instrument needs to be [doorbell in background] protected from depletion. Are there brief queries before [doorbell in background] we close?

# 45.12 
Questioner: I just need to know if there is anything we can do to make the instrument more comfortable or improve the contact?

Ra: I am Ra. [Loud rapping.] All is well, my brothers. [Voice from outside: “Water man.”]

# 45.13
Questioner: What did you say? I couldn’t hear you.

Ra: I am Ra. [Doorbell in background.] All is well, my brothers. I leave you now in the love and in the light of the One Infinite Creator. Go forth, then, rejoicing [truck engine restarted] in the power and the peace of the One Infinite Creator. [Honking.] Adonai.

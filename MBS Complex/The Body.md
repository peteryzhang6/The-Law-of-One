# The Body
One part of the [[Mind-Body-Spirit Complex]]
# Healing
4.17 The second part has to do with the disciplines of the body complexes. In the streamings reaching your planet at this time, these understandings and disciplines have to do with the balance between love and wisdom in the use of the body in its natural functions.  
- 4.18: Imagine the body. Imagine the more dense aspects of the body. Proceed therefrom to the very finest knowledge of energy pathways which revolve and cause the body to be energized. Understand that all natural functions of the body have all aspects from dense to fine, and can be transmuted to what you may call sacramental. This is a brief investigation of the second area.  
## Discipline of the Body
5.2: The second area of learn/teaching is the study/understanding of the body complexes. It is necessary to know your body well. This is a matter of using the mind to examine how the feelings, the biases, what you would call the emotions, affect various portions of the body complex. It shall be necessary to both understand the bodily polarities and to accept them, repeating in a chemical/physical manifestation the work you have done upon the mind bethinking the consciousness.  
  
The body is a creature of the mindâ€™s creation. It has its biases. The biological bias must be first completely understood and then the opposite bias allowed to find full expression in understanding. Again, the process of acceptance of the body as a balanced, as well as polarized, individual may then be accomplished.  
- *The biological bias must be first completely understood and then the opposite bias allowed to find full expression in understanding*
	- To use an example of masculine and feminine: A male first must understand the biological function of a male, of its masculinity. Then seek to understand the feminine. Either through (outside of oneself) interacting with a female, allowing the full expression of the female and understand that expression, or (inside of oneself) find feminine expressions within oneself that is previously not accepted and accept and understand them.
	- Other examples can be seen as
		- bland and spicy
		- endurance of hot and cold temperature
		- tall and short
		- skinny and fat
  
It is then the task to extend this understanding to the bodies of the other-selves whom you will meet. The simplest example of this is the understanding that each biological male is female; each biological female is male. This is a simple example. However, in almost every case wherein you are attempting the understanding of the body of self or other-self, you will again find that the most subtle discernment is necessary in order to fully grasp the polarity complexes involved.

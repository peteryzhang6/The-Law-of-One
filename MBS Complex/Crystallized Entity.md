# Crystallized Entity
47.7: Can you define what you mean by a “crystallized entity?”

**Ra:** I am Ra. We have used this particular term because it has a fairly precise meaning in your language. When a crystalline structure is formed of your physical material the elements present in each molecule are bonded in a regularized fashion with the elements in each other molecule. Thus the structure is regular and, when fully and perfectly crystallized, has certain properties. It will not splinter or break; it is very strong without effort; and it is radiant, traducing light into a beautiful refraction giving pleasure of the eye to many.

52.11: Well, is there then, from the point of view of an individual who wishes to follow the service-to-others path from our present position in third density, is there anything of importance other than disciplines of personality, knowledge of self, and strengthening of will?

**Ra:** I am Ra. This is technique. This is not the heart. Let us examine the heart of evolution.  
  
Let us remember that we are all one. This is the great learning/teaching. In this unity lies love. This is a great learn/teaching. In this unity lies light. This is the fundamental teaching of all planes of existence in materialization. Unity, love, light, and joy; this is the heart of evolution of the spirit.  
  
The second-ranking lessons are learn/taught in meditation and in service. At some point the mind/body/spirit complex is so smoothly activated and balanced by these central thoughts or distortions that the techniques you have mentioned become quite significant. However, the universe, its mystery unbroken, is one. Always begin and end in the Creator, not in technique.

To achieve crystallization, one need to practice [[Discipline of Personality]]

I think one can also have a crystallized mind in such an understanding can be build. 

For example, a crystallized mind will think of the digits 0-9 as:
- 0 - The Infinite Creator; GOD
- 1 - The Law of One; Oneness
- 2 - Duality; Yin and Yang
- 3 - Trinity; God, Son, and Holy Spirit
- 4 - 四 in Chinese and sounds like 死 (Death); an incarnation
- 5 - 五 in Chinese and sounds like 我 (I; me); an identity we take on in an incarnation
- 6 - The 6 senses we have to experience the manifested world
- 7 - The 7 colors of the rainbow; we saw the beauty and unity of the world
- 8 - Turned sideways is Infinity; from 7, we realized infinity and unity
- 9 - 3,6,9; that we seek to return into unity
- (1)0 - A cycle complete; the God grew with more knowledge, understanding, Love and Light of the Law of One

10 is a decade, and a cycle (10) of decades is a century, and a cycle of centuries is a millennium

In Buddhism view, the 1000 worlds (三千大千世界) where number 3 is used as a cycle, thus
- the decade is the small 1000-world (小千)
- the century is the median 1000-world (中千)
- the millennium is the big 1000-world (大千)

In Law of One's term, a cycle is 7 and the cycle can be sub into 7 sub levels and so on and on. Thus
- 7 is the small cycle
- 7x7=49 is the median cycle
- 49x7=343 is the big cycle

Like [[Tesla Nikola]] said, understand the relation between 3, 6, and 9 will reveal you the truth of this universe:
- 3 is the small cycle (3= 3^1 = 3)
- 6 is the median cycle (6 = 3^2 = 9)
- 9 is the big cycle (9 = 3^3 = 27)

# Healing of the Mind
>4.17:
>Firstly, the mind must be known to itself. This is perhaps the most demanding part of healing work. If the mind knows itself then the most important aspect of healing has occurred, for consciousness is the microcosm of the Law of One. 

Since all is consciousness, thus the first thing to heal is the mind. This can be understood as the amount of thoughts within our head can possibly cause depression and all kinds of mental illness. The amount of unsorted feeling can cause decreased immunity and possibly cancer. 

The steps of healing the mind can be separated into:
0. Retain silence of the mind
1. Uniting of the positive and negative
2. Acceptance of the unity within the mind
3. Seeing the unity in others' minds
4. Acceptance of the others' minds
5. Seeing and accepting the unity of minds within all
## Prerequisite of Healing
>5.2: 
>We begin with the mental learn/teachings necessary for contact with intelligent infinity. The prerequisite of mental work is the ability to retain silence of self at a steady state when required by the self. The mind must be opened like a door. The key is silence.  
>
>Within the door lies an hierarchical construction you may liken unto geography and in some ways geometry, for the hierarchy is quite regular, bearing inner relationships. 

The reason to practice the ability to retain silence is that in the following practices, one will need to work on uniting the positive and negative polarities. And when one is trying to unite the positives with the negatives, there will be clashes of forces and can quickly cause one to spiral out of control, thus one need to focus on retaining the silence of the mind as the top priority.
## First Mental Discipline  
>5.2:
>To begin to master the concept of mental discipline it is necessary to examine the self. The polarity of your dimension must be internalized. Where you find patience within your mind you must consciously find the corresponding impatience and vice versa. Each thought that a being has, has in its turn an antithesis. The disciplines of the mind involve, first of all, identifying both those things of which you approve and those things of which you disapprove within yourself, and then balancing each and every positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things. Therefore, you must discover this completeness within yourself. 

Example 1: One dislikes other for doing subject A, but then one does subject A and likes it. Thus one need to unite the disliking and liking on subject A by understanding one should forgive other for subject A and reflect within oneself about subject A. Thus creating yin/yang and yang/yin.

Example 2:  One prefers an environment of quietness and stays away from noisy places. So when one is in a quiet place, to balance the quietness of the mind, one should think of the absence of the noise. And when one is in a noisy place, one should think of the absence of the quietness to balance the noise. Thus creating quiet/noisy and noisy/quiet. 

Example 3: One's preference on food in scale of spiciness vs blandness.

One need to realize that within the mind, it contains both the good and the bad. To realize that one may have a preference towards keeping the good (positives) within the mind and pushing out the bad (negatives) to surrounding or to others. Or a vice versa of keeping the bad within and giving the good without.

## Second Mental Discipline
>5.2:
>The second mental discipline is acceptance of the completeness within your consciousness. It is not for a being of polarity in the physical consciousness to pick and choose among attributes, thus building the roles that cause blockages and confusions in the already-distorted mind complex. Each acceptance smooths part of the many distortions that the faculty you call judgment engenders.  

For one to constantly to choose to eat spicy food, this will cause one to build up tolerance to spiciness and possible causes dullness when eat less spiciness, thus the blockages and confusions. 

The acceptance can be accepting the foods as it is and try to enjoy the foods. In practicing this, one becomes less judgmental on the spiciness of the foods, thus reaching a balanced state or natural state of the mind.
## Third Mental Discipline
>5.2:
>The third discipline of the mind is a repetition of the first but with the gaze outward towards the fellow entities that it meets. In each entity there exists completeness. Thus, the ability to understand each balance is necessary. When you view patience, you are responsible for mirroring in your mental understanding, patience/impatience. When you view impatience, it is necessary for your mental configuration of understanding to be impatience/patience. We use this as a simple example. Most configurations of mind have many facets, and understanding of either self polarities, or what you would call other-self polarities, can and must be understood as subtle work. 

Example 1: One see another who consider itself ugly, then the one need to realize that the other is keeping the bad (ugly) within and reaching for the good (beauty) without. 
## Fourth Mental Discipline
>5.2:
>The next step is the acceptance of the other-self polarities, which mirrors the second step.  
## Fifth Mental Discipline
>5.2:
>The fifth step involves observing the geographical and geometrical relationships and ratios of the mind, the other mind, the mass mind, and the infinite mind.

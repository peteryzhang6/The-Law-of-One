# Relation of higher self to 3D self
The relation of higher self and 3D self can be seen as our shadows casted by our body under the Sun. It can also be seen as some of our science inventions are based on the observation and use of 2D beings - plants, animals, insects, minerals, geometric patterns, anime, and such. 

Our shadows do what we do in exact accordance; however, the shadow only shows an outline. Thus we can understand that in observing the 2D beings, it can give us outlines of our social structures, such as a person acts like a dog, a cat, and etc. Organizations act like a wolf pact, a bee hive, and etc. 

So when the 6D beings looking at us, it sees the outline of itself. This observance is one of [[Learn-Teach|teach/learn]]. When we reach out to 6D beings or higher selves, it is an act of [[Learn-Teach|learn/teach]].

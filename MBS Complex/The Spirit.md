# The Spirit
One part of the [[Mind-Body-Spirit Complex]]
# What is the Spirit?
30.2: This spirit complex is the channel whereby the inpourings from all of the various universal, planetary, and personal inpourings may be funneled into the roots of consciousness and whereby consciousness may be funneled to the gateway of intelligent infinity through the balanced intelligent energy of body and mind.

*Personal POV:* The Spirit can be seen as the energy that causes our mind to seek and give things and experiences meanings. Ultimately we all share one spirit - The Spirit of the Infinite Creator, yet we are able to derive different meanings in the same object can be a result of unbalanced intelligent energy of body and mind or simply due to the different local configurations of bodies and minds (DNA?) to manifest different spirit/meaning.

# Si Xiang
Chinese: 四象

Born out of [[Yang-Yin|yin/yang]]

From Google AI: The four aspects of yin and yang are: Opposition, Interdependence, Counterbalance, and Intertransformation.

Fu-Xi (伏羲)'s original concept evolved from the two lines or Yang and Yin into a series of four two line Xiang or symbolic shapes. Placing one line over the other created these. With two lines there are four possible combinations. The lines represented stages of change between the sky (heaven) and the earth.

- Dao is one
- Yin Yang is two
- Si Xiang is four
- Ba Gua is eight

In Law of One's words:
- First calling (prayer) is one, the foundation
- Second calling doubles the previous, thus two
- Third calling is four
- Fourth calling is eight

# Chapter 1
Tao (The Way) that can be spoken of is not the Constant Tao’
The name that can be named is not a Constant Name.
Nameless, is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the Mother of all things.
Thus, the constant void enables one to observe the true essence.
The constant being enables one to see the outward manifestations.
These two come paired from the same origin.
But when the essence is manifested,
It has a different name.
This same origin is called “The Profound Mystery.”
As profound the mystery as It can be,
It is the Gate to the essence of all life.

道可道，非常道；
名可名，非常名。
无，名天地之始；
有，名万物之母。
故常无，欲以观其妙；
常有，欲以观其徼 (jiao:四声)。
此两者，同出而异名，同谓之玄。
玄之又玄，众妙之门

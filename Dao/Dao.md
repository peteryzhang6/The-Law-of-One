正向思维和逆向思维犹如道的阴阳。如果一人能够将正向思维的终点与逆向思维的起点和逆向思维的终点与正向思维的起点做链接，那么永恒的道就会浮现 （The meaning of ouroboros)
- positive thinking and negative thinking; uncontrolled positive thinking leads to toxic positivity; uncontrolled negative thinking leads to depression

The return to one is the act of untangle the knotted conscious and break it into streams of conscious that are independent of each other. Thus the form of Dao. Or being described as the waves of water. From Dao comes one is when two streams makes contact, the creation of free will is formed as from the point of contact, a new stream emerges while interacting with the two cutoff empty river beds. The two empty river beds are the two obvious choices, thus the two. However, if the flow is strong enough, a new bedding will be created, thus three. Then when this third stream interact with the old two beddings, creates the infinite choices. And eventually all streams will flow into the ocean down the earth and through the upward forces that is created by the forever upward spiral of the earth or the rotation of earth, the water will again emerges as individualize conscious, thus the never ending cycle of creation, of life and death.
